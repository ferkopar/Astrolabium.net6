    <Text>The Sun is referred to as the star at the center of our solar system. It is a sphere, around which the Earth and the other planets rotate in an elliptical orbit, which causes the distance between the two to vary. The Sun is enormous in relation to the planets, approximately 700 times larger than all the planets put together. Although from the Earth, the Sun seems to cross above us symmetrically from East to West every day, it only appears to be so. Following the Vernal Equinox the Sun moves to the North until the 21st of June (in the Northern Hemisphere the day with the shortest night) when it reaches its climax in Cancer. It changes directions turning south continuing past the autumnal equinox until reaching its turning point in Capricorn on the 22nd of December, in the northern hemisphere the day with the longest night.



The Sun was naturally the first and most important celestial body to be observed by man and therefore plays an import role in mythology. The Sun is personified by Apollo (in Greek mythology) and by Hellos (in Roman mythology). This god brought life energy, enlightenment and healing. In Astrology the position of the Sun describes our personalities. People who are not yet well acquainted with Astrology refer to themselves as Pisces if the Sun was in the sign Pisces at the time of their birth. Naturally, the Sun is a very important part of the interpretation but it remains merely one factor among many. A well-placed Sun enables us to radiate joy, confidence and strength as well as fight off disease. The Sun corresponds to the sign Leo, which has the same attributes.

    <TextId>Your Sun in Aries</TextId>
    <Text>The zodiac begins with Aries, a fire sign, ruled by Mars. Here, original life impulses and emerging energies are found. Aries represents the beginning of development and does not concern itself with the past. The Aries prefers to move forward without looking back. An Aries personality has enormous potential for energy and motivation. People born under this cardinal sign, are constantly on the lookout for new directions in which they can pioneer. The disadvantage is a lack of endurance and interest to stay with a task for an extended period of time.



If you could learn to concentrate your energy potential to accomplish a specific goal, you would find it easier to be successful. Instead of taking the time to think and plan you want to act on impulse. Consider the needs of others more carefully if you want to avoid ending up alone at the top because nobody was able to keep up with you. You tend to overlook important details and then later wonder what went wrong. This should motivate you to plan your actions thoroughly or include others in the planning. Do not be too quick to discount the advice of others; listen to well-intended suggestions, and you will find that it can be to your advantage.



You are challenged by your own ambition. Because your leadership qualities are undisputed, you receive recognition that is essential for you. 

If you are able to develop more sensitivity and treat others with diplomacy, nothing will stand in the way of your success, because the really positive aspect of Aries is that they never give up.

    <TextId>Your Sun in Taurus</TextId>
    <Text>Determination and ambition characterize Taurus, an earth sign. Taureans are challenged not to be seduced by the material comforts of life; they also know to enjoy their well-earned successes.



Because Taurus is ruled by Venus, you have a lively interest in the pleasant side of life. You are a sensual person and materially oriented, preferring to see tangible results. Do not make the mistake of defining yourself by your possessions.



You require security and stability in your life and like to work for your retirement. You do not want to be bothered with financial worries and are also prepared to work for financial stability. You do not find it difficult to work for a long time on a task, but it should be something sensible. You like gardening and would even enjoy building a house. You spend money responsibly. Earning interest makes you very happy. When provoked, you can forget about comfort and raise hell, as Taureans are known to do. But it takes a while to reach that point.



In romantic relationships you tend to be jealous and possessive. On the other hand, no other sign of the Zodiac can develop the loyalty of a Taurus. It is important for you to learn that you cannot own people, but that they have willingly decided to share a part of their life with you.

    <TextId>Your Sun in Gemini</TextId>
    <Text>The sign Gemini is ruled by the planet Mercury and is considered an Air Sign. You are known for your ability to communicate and are easy going. Contact to others is essential to you. You love a good conversation and take care to express yourself precisely. You also keep yourself informed of daily events. The media branch fascinates you; you may find a future career in it. Since Gemini is an Air Sign you find it easy to learn about any field. Take the time to withdraw to a quiet place; relaxation and reflection does you a lot of good. If you allow yourself the luxury more often you will find that you have more energy. Be careful not to let yourself get caught up in disputes which leave you exhausted and upset your inner balance. Learn to differentiate between useful information and activities from those that are unimportant; this will help you avoid overloading yourself. You may find that putting your creative energies into writing may help you to find the necessary composure to organize your thoughts.



You are creative and are always interested in the latest fad. If you were not able to get the education you wanted in your youth, you will try to compensate for this deficit for the rest of your life.



If you do not have enough change in your life, you may become moody and may even take your resentment out on the people around you. To avoid this, be sure to keep your mind alert and stimulated. Take time to think about your role in this universe and do not always react to criticism from your friends by being insulted because that will not help you.

    <Text>Cancer is a water sign that causes people to be sensitive and want to share their feelings with others. It is also a feminine sign, and is associated with the Moon, standing for the female potential in a person. Your emotions are determined by the phases of the Moon. Emotional stability will never be one of your strengths, which can drive people around you crazy. A satisfying home life gives you security; this is why you have all the necessary qualities to create it. Sensitivity is one of your strengths, but also one of your weaknesses, whereby you are especially hurt when you are laughed at.



You prefer to hide your soft nucleus under a thick shell. You are afraid to admit your vulnerability. You should learn to accept your mistakes and weaknesses and open yourself up to others. This will allow you to live up to your potential. You are capable of giving affection and warmth, so much so that it is a shame not to put these qualities to use. You need others and should overcome your fear of rejection.



You have a good imagination, but a confused mind. You are not ambitious enough to put your talents to use. Overcome your inhibitions about telling people what you really think, sometimes it takes a long time for you to express yourself openly and directly. Try to assert yourself with resolute and clear effort. This will be good for your self-confidence.

    <TextId>Your Sun in Leo</TextId>
    <Text>The fire sign, Leo, is ruled by the Sun, or the great light, as medieval Astrologers phrased it. The element of fire means the recognition and fulfillment of future possibilities. The Sun gives us the energy we need for our daily activities. It is the center of all life and represents the vitality in us.



Leos are generous people who sometimes have a stately emotional life. Leos are generously endowed with love, gratefulness and charm that they like to give to others. Leos live by their convictions and invest all their energy in their personalities. People born under the sign Leo find the influence of Sun symbolism as a challenge to become radiant. This abundance of positive qualities does not save Leos from having to learn to find themselves and their own energy independently of others. In other words, the Leos' most important task is to find himself.



You like to be in the limelight of a privileged position. You enjoy leaving a lasting impression on people. Your guardian angel helps you, appearing when you most need her. Practically, this means that your problems seem to vanish just when you start feeling trapped by them. 



For a Leo, nothing is more important than the own inner world. You find it difficult to overcome yourself and accept that others see things differently. You sometimes have trouble recognizing the needs of those around you. Leo, in contrast to Libra, Cancer and Pisces, is not a sign of relationships.



You hate routines and become impatient when things do not progress at your speed. You are quick to be insulted by criticism and often cannot understand what others find wrong with you. You are convinced of yourself and of your abilities and crave for recognition. You cannot be overlooked because you inspire awe. As soon as you have received your necessary allotment of admiration, you can be generous and open-heartedly share your riches with others. You remind people of a king from a fairy tale who is kind, whenever he is not fighting off an evil enemy or sees his kingdom threatened. When it is necessary you should appear simple and humble and make use of your creative potential.

    <Text>People born under the Earth Sign Virgo tend to place their professional careers first. Virgo is the most realistic sign, which is ruled by the planet Mercury and is constantly in search of knowledge, which can immediately be put into practice. Virgos can differentiate precisely; a simple yes or no is never enough.



Your love of detail allows you to work with care and precision. Disorder and sloppiness only serve to challenge you to straighten up your surroundings. You like your work, enjoy fulfilling obligations and therefore must watch out not to let yourself be used or exploited. You have often placed too much importance on work and have missed the pleasant side of life.



You analyze your surroundings rigorously and are capable of loosing yourself in details to the point where you are not able to put the pieces together to make a whole. Do not forget the importance of recognizing the essentials in life. Do not let yourself get caught up in banalities.



Practice being tolerant and be aware of the danger of taking your views too seriously. You are capable of realizing your visions but have to learn to accept that some people have other ways of doing things. 



The sign Virgo represents health. Do not let your many worries exhaust you, this could prove harmful to your health. Basically, worrying is pointless because you will never change the course of events by worrying about them. 



The ties between the sign Virgo and the Earth explain why you value material riches and the comfort they bring. You look for quality when you shop and despise cheap mass-produced items.



Even if you are not the most romantic person and pride yourself on your autonomous, single lifestyle, you are hiding a great longing for security. You may want to reconsider your exaggerated demands on a partner.



Women, born under the sign Virgo, dominate relationships and organize the daily routines in the family. You have no reason to feel guilty about it; it just shows that you are prepared to accept responsibility.

    <Text>Libra, being a Cardinal and an Air Sign, allows you to direct your energies towards goals and initiate new situations. You prefer to plan your activities with others because you do not like being alone. The planet Venus, which rules over Libra, radiates pleasant qualities in search of harmony. You are charming and know how to dress tastefully. You want to be recognized, but are not willing to sacrifice your principles for it. It is more important to be able to smile at your reflection in the mirror.



You like to revel in thoughts of romance and fantasize about melting together with an ideal partner. You fear conflict, jealousy and hate because they contradict your aesthetic ideal of truth. This does not keep you from persevering and effectively organizing your daily activities. Be careful not to let your desire for perfection cause you to overload yourself.



Your polished manners and weakness for the finer art of living enable you to take center stage. With your friendly, courteous nature you will do well in a profession working with people.



Libra is an air sign. This is why you use reason to create visions of the best possible human society. You do everything to find your ideal, professionally and in relationships. Your sense of diplomacy and justice should make you popular and allow you to count on the help of your friends.

    <Text>Scorpio is a fixed water sign ruled by the planets Pluto and Mars. This constellation creates a lot of energy, which may be released suddenly. Scorpios, due to their water quality, are usually motivated by emotion, making them difficult to predict.



You do not take things lightly, but try to get to the root of the matter. Lies and half-truths make you angry, but when your own success is threatened, you are not immune to dishonesty. It is not easy to break your will. Like no other Sign of the Zodiac, Scorpios display a certain strength of regeneration and transformation, which allows you to get through the worst crises unscathed. You like using challenges to test your limits. It is essential for you to act out of the right motives, because you are capable of causing havoc when your vision is clouded by your own egotistical ambitions. You can use your abilities as you choose, either to manipulate and humiliate or to build up and support others. You have trouble letting go of defeats.



Sexuality and passion play a large role in your life. You strive to unite with the universe and can probably achieve this best erotically. Restrain your jealousy and do not turn sexuality into a stupid power struggle if you intend to enjoy it and tap its energy. Your understanding of the cycles of eternal life overrides your fear of death.

    <Text>Sagittarius is a mutable fire sign always searching for new experiences. It requires intellectual freedom and does not let itself be constrained by exterior conditions or by pensive reservations. The planet Jupiter, with its prominent qualities, charity and magnitude rules Sagittarius. It is always standing by as a guardian angel and brings needed luck, even when you think that it is too late.



You are open to other people and go through life with optimism. Your search for truth leads you to wonder about the meaning of life and constantly strive for higher knowledge. You find ethical and philosophical topics interesting and like to share your wisdom with others. Social responsibility is a high priority. You must take care not to indiscriminately measure others by your standards; you may be lacking the necessary sensitivity to make a fair judgment. With sarcasm you may unintentionally hurt those around you. You should not wonder if others find your behavior arrogant and accuse you of being dogmatic and you find yourself isolated. In these moments, exercise tolerance and try to put yourself in the position of the other.



Your steadfast principles may make others appear conservative, which is only partially true, because you hold your own standards as the highest authority. People born under the sign Sagittarius are convinced that life is an adventure, a journey and a search for hidden treasure.



Your intuition allows you to understand the future significance of actions and makes you aware that everything we see and experience on a daily basis is the result of mankind's history.



Sagittarius is the most adventurous sign of the zodiac. This can be traced back to the planet Jupiter, which likes to remain at a distance, the farther the better. You are very open to foreign cultures and will probably develop your own personal view of the world during your lifetime.

You do not shy away from taking on responsibility for yourself or for others and are willing to work hard for it. You define your goals clearly. Your determination causes you to make realistic plans. Because Capricorn is an Earth sign, you will devote your life to working conscientiously towards fulfilling your obligations. This may include working in a larger framework, because you are not afraid of openly addressing the public. You can organize effectively and can be an example when it comes to endurance and reliability. If you become interested in politics and decide to actively participate, you will find that you have all the energy you will need. If you pursue a career to gain prestige you will be successful because you are truly a wonder of self-discipline. You will find your connections and contacts useful.



You concentrate on essentials and do not allow yourself to be distracted. It is not difficult for you to respect law and order, because you tend to follow the prescribed form. Do not become too fascinated with the social position or status symbols of others, it seldom leads to real friendships. Do not put yourself under pressure to succeed. Enjoy time with your loved ones, it will do you good. You will probably find growing old pleasant and become more relaxed than you were in your youth.

Friendship and solidarity are of great importance for you. This can be traced back to the planet Uranus, which rules the sign Aquarius. Your friends know that they can depend on you because Uranus fosters philanthropy and humanitarian ideals.



You demonstrate originality and are proud to be different from all the others. You have thousands of fantastic ideas and a sense for unconventional problem solving. However, you should not try to evade taking action yourself and let others work to realize your plans. Basically, you are aware of your responsibility and are a kind person. If you are sometimes considered a bit of a crackpot and not taken seriously, remember that not everyone can paint the future as brightly as you do and not everyone is prepared to take unconventional steps toward realizing their goals. You have high ideals and love truth above all else. Take care not to become impatient and get a reputation for being an upstart, constantly criticizing destructively without offering a better alternative.



You will never complain about a lack of company, because you need lots of contact and feel most comfortable in a group. You share your ideas and reflect on any topic that is currently being discussed. You are open for anything new and are spirited, even if sudden, unexpected changes upset you. You pay also special attention to practicing the equality of the sexes in everyday life.

    <Text>Due to your sensitive nature you are able to pick up on mood changes in your surroundings. Sometimes it is hard to tell if it is a blessing or a curse because your extraordinary perception can cause internal confusion. You are like a sponge, taking in everything indiscriminately, later wondering which are your own emotions and opinions. You often complain about hard reality. Your beautiful "dream world" will not provide a permanent solution; you are going to have to learn to get along with the way things are. You should withdraw more often and try to relax with good literature.



Pisces, being the last of the twelve Sun signs, takes on something from each one. You are swimming in the great ocean of the diversity of signs. This may not always be easy. You often have trouble making a decision because Neptune, the ruler of Pisces, is clouding your thoughts. You should try to appear more determined, investing your energy in concrete ambitions. Do not allow yourself to become dependent on the goodwill of others, insist on standing on your own two feet. First, you must overcome your fear and become aware of your great potential. 



In the creative arts, especially music, you are able to impress those around you with your successes. You will reach your life's goal by activating your filter and learning to differentiate the problems that should be addressed from those which do not concern you. You may find strength in faith, Christianity is embodied in the sign Pisces, and the character Jesus Christ may describe the qualities and potential of this sign well. You are capable of honest sympathy and may find your calling in charity work. Be careful of drugs, they can become dangerous more quickly than you think.

You can express all of your energy through your appearance, which is why you are not very good at deception. When you set out to do something, you have to be emotionally committed to your goal. Watch out that you do not just think of yourself, but take other people's feelings into consideration before acting. It may be in your professional interest to go into business for yourself. Then no one will expect you to compromise with colleagues or with the boss.  The results of your business will tell if you are on the right track.



If the Sun forms a conjunction with the Moon, you were born during the new Moon of that month. This is the beginning of a new cycle that applies to the area of the chart where the Sun and the Moon are found. Here you can be especially successful. These sides should harmonize well with each other because the Sun represents male energy and the Moon female.



Your situation at home is very important to you and you will fulfill every requirement to make it as pleasant as possible. You will not let anyone tell you how to run your personal life, because you know exactly what you want.

Your astounding intellectual abilities may drain your energy when you do your best not to miss out on anything. Take time to let your many talents recuperate.



You can be very creative and produce a lot of good ideas but be prepared before acting to ensure success. Once in a while it would do you good not to take yourself so seriously and be a little more humble.

Do not restrict your search for its cause to the outside world or to other people, but look also within yourself. The relationship to your parents, especially to your father, can play a large role. You should analyze the problem and integrate your insights into your personality.



You will reach your goal only with a lot of effort; do not expect to get anything for free. When you are disappointed you are quick to believe that the demands of life are too much for you. Do not let yourself get pulled down, or you will miss opportunities for growth and development that you really should not let go by. Once you have overcome these hurdles, you will have a right to be proud. Once your confidence develops your organizational talents will bring you considerable success.

Do not shut yourself off from current events but continue your education so that you can maintain a balance to your emotions. This conjunction may make it difficult for you to differentiate between reality and fantasy. Neptune arouses some rather unusual expectations that can result in a preoccupation with success and recognition. 



You should learn to become more conscious of reality. Much of what you would perceive will not be to your liking, but the sooner you accept the challenge, the better you will be able to cope with it and stop letting destructive fantasies make your life difficult. If you give up your unrealistic ideas and expectations, you will not suffer so much from disappointments.

Do not make the mistake of placing yourself and your needs above others. Both should be combined together in harmony. Do not let your latent power hunger and your authoritarian tendencies get out of control, otherwise you may end up in isolation. Recognize that everyone has a right to an own opinion.

    <Text>The longing to be someone, combined with your self-content, may actually be preventing you from recognizing how much people like you. When you take something on, you like to realize it in your own way without others giving you orders. It may be difficult for you to submit to the will of other people when the situation requires it. If you should ever experience resistance in your surroundings you should be able to use your creativity successfully.



Making friends is easy for you. If you are not able to win everybody's friendship, you are annoyed. If you would try to restrain your conceit a little, it would do you good.

    <Text>The influential position you have attained both professionally as well as socially will put you in a position to help others. Maybe you are in a profession that involves politics or public appearances. You should definitely consult the remaining aspects to the Sun.



This conjunction can also show that your dominant parent exercised influence over you at an early age and took part in a large portion of your development until now. The relation of the rest of your chart to the Sun and the tenth house will tell if your relationship to this parent is a kind of dependency or a personal challenge.

    <Text>If the Sun forms an opposing aspect to the Moon, you were born during the full moon. Everyone knows that a full moon can create a charged atmosphere. You may find it very difficult to make decisions. Your emotional receptivity and will power can constantly be in conflict with each other causing you to experience tensions in dealing with others. Also take care of your health because the Moon and the Sun can have a strong influence on your physical energy. Do something about stress and nervousness. If you do not calm down, your energy reserves will soon be depleted. If you were to try out meditation and relaxation techniques you could resolve your past which would then allow your means of expression to blossom leaving nothing which could be in the way of solving a conflict.

Possibly you have pronounced aggression, which attracts quarrels like moths to a flame. Become aware of the effects of your aggression on your surroundings and develop more sensitivity.



It would be better for you to divert your excess energy to sports, but watch out that the soccer referee does not show you the red card. Choose your surroundings carefully and use a little more common sense. If you try using diplomacy you will see that not everyone rejects you.

    <Text>Try to avoid appearing overenthusiastic and out of touch. The feeling of being constantly under pressure to perform comes from your tendency to pretend to have talents you wish you had. Having never owned a spaceship, you want to bring the stars down from the sky. Sometimes your friends get annoyed because you try to push your ideology on them, which you see as the only valid way of thinking. Try not to develop expectations that are too arrogant and unrealistic; if you overdo it, one day you may find yourself lonely and forsaken.



In striving for recognition and success be sure to call on the right advisor. Maybe you would be better able to recognize your limitations and to leave someone else the jobs that you are not qualified to do. This may result in creative teamwork, which would be a good working environment for you. Stay in touch with the people who gave you your professional training. Let them know you are grateful and you will be able to count on their help in the future.

    <Text>This is a constellation that can greatly restrict your personal expression. Others may sometimes think that you are distant and humorless. In relations with the opposite sex these qualities will not have an especially positive effect. If you do not do something, you will go down in history as an unapproachable loner. Actually you just want to find out who or what you are.



The primary inhibiting factor to your success has been your inability to like yourself, even a little. Possibly your parents were authoritarian and placed you within boundaries which you were not permitted to overstep. If no space for self-realization was provided for you, then you should simply claim the space you need. There is no sense in waiting for others to take the initiative for you that could take a long time. Instead, use the waiting period to develop a sense of humor, it will certainly be of more use to you.

    <Text>Getting your way is a top priority for you, whereby you do not always proceed in a very sensible manner. Your concepts of independence and freedom may put some people off. This also causes problems in relationships. The next time you go about changing your convictions, remember to turn on your brain first. Your friends expect to have to constantly redefine their image of you because their experience with you has shown that tomorrow everything may have changed completely. Your hectic pace can cause stress that can have an effect on your physical vitality.



Sometimes you can upset people by insisting on being traditional. Extreme mood swings make it difficult for anyone to be your friend. Do not act impulsively because you are not going to get away with everything, even if you consider yourself to be a genius with extraordinary talents. These talents may actually exist, but ask for advice from others before putting them to use.



Humility and moderate behavior would suit you well. Make more of an effort to get your feet back on the ground because you are truly capable of putting your plans into practice.

Possibly you are inclined to be intolerant of the weaknesses in your partner. If you do not make more of an effort to be objective, you will have to accept some disappointments. 



A reluctance to make decisions and a general uncertainty about what you should do with your life can become problematic when you unintentionally deceive others and it can provoke unforeseeable reactions. You simply need a better feel for the reality you are confronted with daily. You should not get trapped in your dream world. Once you have understood this, you will be able to grow with the challenges of this aspect.

    <Text>This aspect gives you a very unique will. You could take your interests so seriously that you violate the needs of others. When you feel misunderstood, you may be inclined to fits of rage or you may pout and sulk, which tends to happen frequently. This should come as no surprise because you only seldom reveal your motives and feelings. In spite of this, you insist that others follow your commands. Open yourself up a little and afford a glimpse at your inner processes to the people closest to you, at the very least. This will make the entire situation easier. The problem is much more than your convictions, it is also the manner in which you express them. Your ideas can be wonderful, but if you cannot express them tactfully; no one will listen to you. Once you have realized this, the inevitable conflicts brought about by your obstinate character can be diverted.



The same processes can also make your love life complicated. It would do you good to practice moderation and behave more reasonably, whereby your ability to compromise would be a great help to you.

It is as if you are suppressing your ego to avoid facing new experiences, preferring to live through the tried and true negative experiences one more time. Almost compulsively you continue your familiar patterns of behavior and identify so strongly with them, that you are unable to explain your failure. Try to overcome your inhibitions about opening up and looking more optimistically towards the future. Then you will find friends who can give honest feedback. You need positive energy of the kind indicated by your Sun position so that you can devote more energy to your work.

Go ahead and take yourself a little more seriously, then no one can be as insignificant as you can sometimes feel.



An attraction to successful people may lead you to try to imitate them. Look deeper within yourself, become more aware of your talents and do not try to please others, because you cannot keep it up for long. Your behavior may have been influenced by your relationship to your parents. Become more aware of how strong your ties to them are and think about starting to let go. This will improve your relationships and free more energy that you can then invest in your career.

Maybe your creative talents lie hidden in darkness. If you cannot find emotional harmony, you will never find a permanent solution to your problems. It is possible that your family is keeping you from expressing your individual qualities.



Look for a means to let off steam or you will hardly experience satisfaction with your life. You fight frequently and your defensiveness does not make your situation any easier. If you should feel a desire to change, you will have to give up your defensive position and take the needs of others more frequently into consideration. This requires a certain amount of effort, only it is not clear how the end result should look. There is, namely, a wide discrepancy between your ideal and your willingness to exert yourself in order to realize it. Be aware that the fulfillment of your personal desires depends on your reaction to the circumstances.

If you want to avoid arousing anger, make an attempt to restrain yourself. Before doing anything, be sure you know exactly what you want. Make an effort to control your anger and exercise patience and tolerance; this is the only way to achieve your ambitions without entangling yourself in conflicts.



Watch that you do not waste your energies in senseless power struggles. Your talents could bring you much success; merely respect the borders that will be a part of every profession. Independence is important to you, and you should know what you are getting into before tying yourself down professionally or in your private life.

This aspect can point to a tendency for arrogance as well as to excesses in the areas associated with the houses and signs where the Sun and Jupiter are found. You are probably very generous, although you do not give without harboring expectations. Make an effort not to become intolerant; trying to push your ideology on others.

Because you may frequently experience disappointments in the course of your life, you should not let them get you down. This is easier said than done, but remember the alternatives. It will not help you to fall into depression and to lament about the state of the world before you have swept in front of your own house.



You may have to make some bitter experiences in the areas of life of the houses where the Sun and Saturn are found. You really have no choice but to work through these experiences and integrate them into your personality.



Success was not handed to you on a silver platter, and you will have to discover your own abilities before you can utilize them effectively. Once you learn to stand resolutely, you should be able to come to terms with life and accept your experiences with an optimistic gaze toward the future.

Although your inventiveness is limitless, your plans are either too impractical to be applied or are sabotaged by your lack of self-discipline. Your working style is seldom characterized by constancy, but is rather explosive in nature, which can astonish your colleagues.



You can be very stubborn, and with Uranus in the game, you may suddenly bloat up and start taking yourself too seriously. In addition, you loathe all stereotypical processes, which, if you do not watch out, may cause you to wind up in the social discard pile. Try not to get nervous in critical situations or your unpredictable behavior will destroy everything you have built. If you were to take the suggestions of others to heart, your life might take on more constructive contours.

It may be important to you to be special. It is a noble intention to want to leave a good impression on the planet. Endeavor to serve humanitarian goals with your activities and not just express your eccentric ideas, which do not really have a practical value for others. If you escape into a dream world you will never take responsibility for yourself and discipline will remain a foreign concept. Possibly you have such unrealistic wishes, that their fulfillment could be your ruin. It would do you good to listen to the advice of people you feel close to, who could direct your positive steps in the right direction.

You do not talk about your motivation or your thoughts very often. Still, you are stubborn and always insist on having the last word, which does not exactly bring the people around you to stand up and cheer.



Try to open up somewhat. Go to other people and do not expect anyone to follow you without contradiction. This will help you get a grip on your egotism. If you become more humble and conform to the circumstances, you will probably discover another side of your personality.

A great problem could be a lack of honesty, which you do not want to realize in spite of the criticism you receive. Your desire to be liked everywhere you go may be pronounced, but will only be fulfilled if you learn to be humble. Let people get closer to you then you will see that people will feel more comfortable around you.



If you are used to opposition, you will have learned to deal with backslides and to see them as character building experiences. Do not react too aggressively, that can cause problems especially at work. If you can learn to express your views with sensitivity, you would be happier.

It should be possible to achieve a balance between the masculine and feminine sides of your personality. Also you should be able to maintain a warm relation to your environment, because you are joyful and confident. 



Take care not to remain passively in the background when your help is needed. As with all harmonious aspects, there is a danger of getting lazy when things are going well. You have more than enough creative talent that you can use profitably when dealing with people if you could only get motivated. People are moved by you and will hold onto the memories of their encounters with you for a long time.

You have a good sense of self-esteem and integrity. No one would call you lazy, and you master complicated situations brilliantly. Your greatest advantage is knowing that you can use your abilities practically and constructively.



This aspect foretells a strong fire component because both the Sun and Mars are associated with fire signs. People consider you to be an enthusiastic representative of the human species and they encourage you to participate.

A large energy reserve, both physical and mental, allows you to lead a satisfying life and also support people less fortunate than you. You are an honest person, abide by the law and act according to the norms of morality. Your intuitive vision allows you an occasional peek into the future. Sometimes you feel like fleeing civilization; then you retreat into nature.



It may be difficult to find a way to use your creative energies sensibly. You have an inclination to occasionally step back and remain passive. As with every harmonious aspect there is a danger of becoming too passive, when things are going well. Go ahead and take on a little more.

Your outlook on life leads one to assume that you are honest, practical and crazy. Both finances and your own energy are used sparingly, whereby you apply both primarily to realizing practical and sensible plans. Your power of concentration and your organizational talents are put to use in a disciplined manner, even when you are pursuing ambitious goals; they are achieved due to sacrificial effort.



You are not necessarily lucky in a traditional sense of the word, but you tend intuitively to do the right thing at the right time, such that you will never suffer poverty in difficult times. Your sober rationality has put together financial reserves to get you over any time of need. You have learned to be patient and to avoid risky enterprises.

Sometimes problems that you have been struggling with for a long time suddenly solve themselves. The esoteric field of study should actually fascinate you and if you sense a desire to take a closer look at Astrology, you should definitely follow up on it. It has already lead many people to a more comprehensive understanding of life's basic regularities.



Generally you are open to experimentation because you know that it will broaden your experiences. Also you have nothing against sharing proposals you have developed with people who are dissatisfied with the existing social conditions. However, you insist on working toward a peaceful goal by peaceful means. In light of the wars being fought presently, your humanitarian outlook brings you to believe that more solidarity is what the world needs most.



The effect you have on your surroundings is fundamentally positive, largely because you are able to keep your interests in the background. People tend to feel motivated when they work with you and generate new energies that can support their efforts to direct their own lives into directions that will lead to satisfaction. People know that you will take their problems seriously. Concern that you may need help someday serves as a motivation to give to others.

Express your ideas clearly and understandably, otherwise you could lose yourself in irrational dreams that the people around you cannot accept. The danger is not very great and you are probably capable of structuring your life so that you instinctively do the right thing. You let yourself be driven, but also recognize opportunity when it presents itself and can take advantage of it. You even gain insights into economic aspects.

Perhaps you are interested in esoteric fields or have spiritual powers. You are like a clown, quick to get back on your feet. Perhaps you have a guardian angel that never lets you down. Probably your creative talent will come to life only after you have suffered some defeats. Do not make the mistake of hiding your light under a bushel just because the harmony in this aspect makes you sluggish. Overcome your reluctance to participate. You have the power to realize plans which others do not dare to dream of.

You enjoy criticizing social conditions where more justice is called for. Once you have set your mind on something you will throw yourself in to its realization. Whereby no effort is too great and no journey too long. Sometimes you can proceed energetically, which is generally not criticized but becomes a problem when you take on too much.

Your intellect is alive and active, which pleases your potential lover. Liberal attitudes are responsible for your leniency with small human weaknesses. However, if your partner is being dishonest or treats you unfairly, you cannot tolerate it and will end the relationship.

Even though you know of ways to reduce suffering in your immediate environment you leave this area to others who have more practical experience and feel chosen for this work. This does not mean that you do not have considerable sympathy for the situation of others. The popularity you enjoy is actually due to your sympathy.

    <Text>With your energy reserves you are in a position to help others and enjoy doing so, especially if they are in a miserable situation they get out of it on their own. When you act, it is under the motto, "help to self-help", which is why you reject pity and will never let yourself be used. Bring out your strength of character and proceed tactically. A nearly invisible and influential power is emitted through your person and creates endurance. Even when you think you are completely exhausted you can tap into the hidden energy of the universe. A study of yoga and meditation will help you to bring your esoteric abilities under control.



Anyone who hears you feels drawn to you because you have recognized connections and know what you are talking about. Acquire an ability to communicate and use it to search for the hidden talents of others. Use the trust people place in you not only for your own goals, but to contribute to a better standard of living for everyone on the planet.

Probably, most people like you because you are friendly and honest. You can accept life's challenges without great difficulty, especially when you meet them at the appropriate time.



Naturally such a harmonious aspect harbors the danger of letting you get overconfident or arrogant because success seems to come without effort. If you make yourself aware of the problem, you should be able to find a way to solve it.

The skillful way you express yourself makes others enjoy listening to your rhetorical considerations, which are not only carried out in an awe inspiring manner but are also quite convincing. You are everyone's friend and expect that people feel comfortable with you. Because your humor is contagious, you can liven up any gathering.



Professionally, you should watch out that you do not take on too much, as if you never had the opportunity to stand out and be recognized. Maybe you appear so self-confident that your bosses may start to worry about their jobs.



In your circles you are known for being charming and nice and when it comes to making contacts which may be useful later, you astound even yourself. It seems you are only interested in honest friendships with the people closest to you. For dishonesty, you have absolutely no tolerance in a friendship. It can be the cause of you breaking off the relationship, and then it will be very difficult to win back your trust.

    <Text>If the Sun is in the first house in your chart, then you entered the world within the first two hours of the new Day. Daylight dispels the black of night and people begin to go about their daily tasks.



The exceptional energy radiating from the Sun in this position is not without effect. This is the source of your destiny to serve as an example and to give others strength and energy. Greet life actively and enthusiastically making your way with determination. Your family was not necessarily the primary contributors to your confidence and optimism. You prefer to earn success completely independently and it has brought you a certain amount of respect, which you also crave for. You are the kind of person who wants to stand out in a crowd. It is important for you to know enough about everything to be considered an authority on any subject. This also satisfies your craving for admiration.



Probably you are seldom sick, although a consultation of the sign housing the Sun and its aspects to the other planets is necessary to confirm this. If the Sun and the Ascendant are in the same sign, the qualities of that sign will be especially pronounced.



If the Sun in the first house receives harmonious aspects, you may have had a childhood which made it easy for you to develop your unique capacities, and your birth caused much excitement.



If the Sun in the first house receives challenging aspects, you should take care not to give free reign to your dominant character traits, such as narcissism, and pride.



If you do not manage to regulate your desire to be in control you will end up frustrated and off-balance. Always remember that respect and recognition have to be earned. Do not make the mistake of expecting too much.

    <TextId>Your Sun in the Second House</TextId>
    <Text>In humanistic Astrology, the second house is called the "test of possession", in which you are supposed to learn to deal actively and dynamically with material possessions; to recognize their usefulness but not to become overly attached or worship your growing accumulation of things. Live out your individual talents and improve the awareness of yourself by internalizing important values. You have to recognize what security actually means if you seriously intend to fulfill your wish to become independent. Your satisfaction in life comes from acquiring possessions and from your talent to get along in the physical world. This is one area where you progress with your head held high. Possibly you want to make your way into the scene by impressing others with status symbols. You share your material possessions with others, but should learn not to try to turn a profit from it.



The development of the Sun's energy in the second house is advantageous for you, because you have enough energy to withstand the tests to your detachment. Finally you could develop enough self-assurance to rise above all the challenges of life. This stable base depends on your confidence as well as your financial situation. It is worth trying for even if it does sound a bit pompous.

    <Text>Do not be intimidated by what others might say, bring out the best in your own ideas, insights and points of view. Opening yourself more to others will strengthen your self-confidence. You are at your best while expanding your knowledge or sharing your acquired learning and inspirations with others. The Sun in the third house awakens a desire to be the center of attention. This can aggravate conflicts with siblings, neighbors or relatives, which you actually should be trying to solve. It is important that you avoid making others responsible for your needs and actions.  Try to avoid overemphasizing abstract knowledge.



Inharmonious Aspects to the Sun in the third house may have caused problems in your first years of school. In order to prevent this from effecting your education you should analyze any problems you may have in this area and attempt to find solutions.



Although you make an intelligent and eloquent impression on people, this does not satisfy you. You put everything you have into improving your general education in order to interact more brilliantly with others.

    <TextId>Your Sun in the Fourth House</TextId>
    <Text>In humanistic Astrology, the fourth house stands for the test of stability. In your search, you will have to delve deep within yourself, whereby you will have to find a balance between the necessary material prerequisites for life, which probably are less important to you, and your spiritual progression, including your family life.



Put yourself in a position that lets you see yourself as an independent individual, without having to deny your roots. This is important, because you may both identify with your ancestry and allow your family too much influence over you, or out of a desire to protect yourself from their influence, completely reject your background. It would do you good to try to accept some of your family's values without sacrificing your own identity.



The fourth house is the mother's house, which is essential to a strong sense of security in the early years. The energies unfolding in this house can be experienced through the mother. Your mother may be strong and dominating which may cause you to suffer from permanent self-doubt and think of yourself as a weakling. You should tell your mother what you think of her in order to free yourself from her influence. It may be that your mother was not there for you, either physically or emotionally, which has left you with an unrealistic image of her. In any case, the Sun in the fourth house presents a challenge to look for and find the feminine potential within yourself.



Most probably you have a deep longing to establish a safe and comfortable home to live in. You still need a little time to find the place where it feels right to settle down. Do not expect to find real satisfaction or develop a realistic self-image until later in life.

    <Text>In your chart the Sun finds itself in the house which is, as the Sun itself is, ruled by the sign Leo. Working enthusiastically toward a goal will help develop your character.



Your physical and mental stability is dependent on your ability to communicate your current emotional state to others. If you have trouble deciding which goal to dedicate yourself to, it could have an effect on your health. Your state of health may also suffer from stress due to a work overload. Make decisions about your life's work fully conscious of the consequences and try to be satisfied without overloading yourself. 



You may sense the child within you constantly demanding attention. Even when others tell you that you are creative, you still demand more perfection from yourself. The Sun principle is set for continual expansion. The fifth house concentrates on developing means of self-expression and creative potential.



Utilize you artistic potential in any way you can. This does not imply becoming a second Beethoven or Picasso, but merely any form of creative expression. If you think you can accomplish something in this area, go for it and do not let anyone talk you out of it.



Your love of life finds expression in your hobbies and other leisure activities. Erotic affairs and romantic relationships will immeasurably increase your enthusiasm and your self-confidence. Contact with children not only makes you happy but also offers instruction as an additional reward. You should never expect things of your child that you are not capable of doing yourself. Especially in Germany after the Second World War, it was common for parents to project their unfulfilled wishes onto their children. They wanted to provide their children with a better life than they had, but the children were never asked about their opinion. Avoid grooming your child for presentation as your achievement.



Most probably you enjoy being the center of attention. A challenging aspect of the Sun in this house could induce you to call attention to yourself by any means at your disposal.

    <Text>The Sun in the sixth house will bring you to concentrate your activities on getting your life together. You look after your health, daily routines and your career. You should not get too wrapped up in this, but take on projects that will allow you to improve the spiritual aspects of both your health and general quality of life. At the start, small physical and psychological weaknesses may point to parts of your life which you should look at more carefully.



Try to achieve harmony of body and mind. Take care of your health ahead of time; do not wait until you get sick. If your health is already suffering, it is more important than ever to take care of yourself and find your way back to a holistic lifestyle. Once you have succeeded, nothing will stand in the way of a consultation with others on these topics.



It is important to you to structure your everyday routine as efficiently as possible, clearing up any problems that may hinder you. Developing practical skills will give you character. Do not spend your day dawdling and dreaming. It is possible to achieve insight into the most elemental truths while doing the most boring housework. You probably will not get away with your attempts to avoid restrictions and deny your failures. Once you accept this you will be rewarded with strength and understanding. This does not necessarily have to be apparent to everyone else, what is important is that you are satisfied. You may be amazed at its effect on everything you do.



Work on perfecting your skills and find a sensible way to incorporate them at your workplace, you will find it reassuring. Helping others will prove to be fulfilling.

    <Text>The Sun in the seventh house helps you to develop your friendships, partnerships, your self-confidence and your character. Common activities will raise questions that will inspire you to get to know yourself and to express yourself better. Putting more effort into making honest and upright friendships will improve your character. Surely you know that usually things become clearer by comparison. This is also true for character; it will receive definition through contact to others.



Watch out that you do not hide behind someone else, if you are looking for someone you think will compensate for your weaknesses or for someone to give you direction. You may attempt to gain status or power by attaching yourself to someone powerful who you can worship. Seen psychologically, you may be actually searching for your father. You will never find fulfillment anywhere but within yourself. Anyone else you try to burden with this will probably just leave.



In humanistic Astrology, the test of cooperation is ascribed to the seventh house. Here your relation to the environment is structured. You need to be around people and should choose a profession that will bring you into contact with a lot of people.

    <Text>You long for a union with a "superior being", even if this is not conscious and you deny it to yourself. Try to expand your horizons through more personal contacts and exchanges.



The eighth house stands for other people's life resources. You may strengthen your identity by falling back onto the material possessions of your friends, especially if they have already offered their assistance. You could fulfill your wish to invest your energy in large projects by professionally handling other people's finances.



It is not just the material exchange that is important, but also the emotional. If you have an emotional nature your friendships will bring hidden character traits and unresolved childhood problems to the surface as well as further your development and individual expression associated with the Sun. An erotic relationship can serve to vent frustration and stimulate regeneration and healing after a collapse. You will get the maximum benefit from an intensive relationship with someone of the opposite sex. This will provide all the aggravation you need to progress.



Generally, the eighth house is associated with death and inheritance. Death holds a special fascination for you which causes you to address topics which others avoid. It is to be hoped that you will be able to deal with everything you stir up.

    <Text>With this Sun position you should endeavor to expand your horizons. Take trips, read, and take up philosophy. Your understanding for the interrelatedness of every aspect of life and your intellectual potential could lead to fruitful insights on all levels. You should also be capable of exercising various professions. Probably you are suited for professions that put you in a position to act in public. You could be successful in any branch of the travel industry, whereby you prefer the most distant exotic countries. Generally, you are good at motivating people and at transmitting your ideas, knowledge and enthusiasm. 



You think of life as an experiment. Rigidly following traditional or even outdated philosophies of life is not what it is all about. You want to explore various esoteric fields, philosophies and religions on your search for your own individual truth. You will learn about yourself through exchanges with others.



Take care not to lose touch with reality. You have a tendency to devote yourself to macrocosmic theory. You can plan your future completely ignoring the problems of your present personal situation. It can go so far that your awareness for the well being of humanity leaves no room for you to find answers to your personal questions.

    <Text>This position of the Sun brings your personal development in the context of your professional life. The tenth house concerns itself with the character traits that generate a positive echo from others. In humanistic Astrology, the tenth house is the test of your position, in which the position of a person is defined frequently by their profession. You should pay attention to the sign housing the Sun. It will tell you how the Sun's energy is manifested. 



You also feel a strong desire for recognition. You will do your best, but when you climb for success, be sure that it is not on the backs of others. A little determination never hurt anyone, but the history books are full of characters that overdid it in this respect.



The tenth house is the father's house. You may have identified so strongly with your father that you took on his ambitions as your own. As a father in turn, you could harbor the expectation that your child develops according to your plan. You should take care not to suffocate your child with your personality. Actually, it could develop into a form of symbiosis. Your child, who is ecstatic about any opportunity to demonstrate her talents, would idolize you.



If you have not managed to fulfill your professional ambitions, you may be looking for a relationship with a successful man. Conflicts between professional and private lives could present problems for both sexes in this position. If you want to pursue a career, you should go for it, but be assured that the consequences will include restrictions on your private life. The best solution would be to find your individual professional expression within yourself, which allows you to combine your career with your private life.

As you develop your individuality, make sure that it is bound to something that will make you aware of your collective existence. You could gain respect and recognition through group activities which may eventually lead to a high position or to increased influence over your own or other organizations. Your actual experiences in the group and the results of your activities will depend on the Sun's aspects in this house. 



To advance your development you will need to intensify contacts with your friends. Reciprocal giving and taking will be inspiring and support the realization of your ambitions. Naturally, your goals should be realistic. They will consume a large amount of energy and it would be a shame if the effort were wasted. Your efforts will reflect in your character. 



You could pioneer new movements and trends that influence society. Take care that you do not identify too strongly with a group that has a dogmatic ideology. You do not want to completely sacrifice your individuality.



Retain the ability to differentiate between your own opinions and the ideology the group wants to sell you.

    <TextId>Your Sun in the Twelfth House</TextId>
    <Text>In humanistic Astrology, the twelfth house is a place for spring-cleaning. This may seem confusing at first, but the twelfth house is the end of a cycle that is renewed in the first house. Something should happen here to prepare the way for a more beautiful new beginning. The twelfth house will also help each individual attain its highest potential, although the energies at work here are collective by nature and serve to restrain the ego.



This recognition and mastery can be compared with untying a knot. When the ego and communal spirit melt together latent gifts may awaken within you. You have the capacity to pioneer new fields. Your visions of a peaceful and ecological planet Earth should definitely be made available to others, whereby you could creatively move others through the arts. Your ability to see beyond your own shadow enables you to recognize the needs of others and generally lend assistance to efforts designed to rectify unacceptable conditions both in the society at large or in your immediate surroundings. Dare to instigate reform, a time may come when you will not have any other choice.



If the Sun has a challenging aspect in the twelfth house you may have to fight against false pride, conceit and arrogance.  This may lead you to assume that all the world's benefits are laid out for you to take what you want with no concern for the rest of the world.



On another level, the twelfth house deals with institutions. The Sun indicates that various institutions could eventually play a role in your life, whether professionally or privately. This includes hospitals, charitable institutions or stations in which people are confined.



You are very sensitive and notice signals from your surroundings. This makes it necessary for you to withdraw periodically to maintain enough distance necessary to clear your head. You will have to watch out that the circumstances do not eat into you to the point where you are unable to live a normal life.

    <TextId>The Moon - The Emotional Attitude</TextId>
    <Text>The Moon does not travel around the Earth in an exact circular orbit but moves elliptically. Its diameter is approximately 3500 kilometers making it a tiny speck of dust in the universe. People have found its constantly changing form fascinating, giving rise to innumerable myths, legends and tales. While the Sun is associated with male consciousness, the Moon is seen as female. Women's menstrual cycles are in accord with the 28-day Moon cycles. Moon goddesses have been described diversely as moody, dark and cruel or as life giving and sensitive. They have been called Demeter, Hera, Artemis, Hecate or Persephone. Even the Virgin Mary has been often portrayed as a Moon crescent.



The Moon's influence on the Earth and its inhabitants should not be underestimated. If it is responsible for the changes in tide, why shouldn't it also alter our body fluids?



The phase of the Moon at the time of birth is a very important facet of astrological interpretation. The waning Moon is a period for concentration and gathering, with all energies turned inward. The new Moon is the climax of this development. The waxing Moon is the opposite, a time for growth and allowing emotions to be expressed freely. Everyone has at least once in his or her lifetime spent restless or even sleepless nights on a full Moon. Quite a few locations like Koh Phangan in Thailand or Goa in India have institutionalized "Full Moon Parties" which attract thousands of people at a time.



In a horoscope the Moon is associated with the sign Cancer and represents the subconscious, emotional disposition, fertility, creative energies, the home, family, mother and the reception of other people's moods. You can tell if someone tends to be moody or emotionally stable.

    <Text>You are an adventurer known for your longing for independence, in spite of its contradiction to the qualities of the moon which tend more toward a desire for warmth and security. You can make a restless impression on people and go to great lengths to repress your fear of commitment. You find it difficult to appreciate your feminine side or to take responsibility for the welfare of others. A stable relationship makes you feel like you are bound and chained. It will take you a long time to get over this and make concessions for a relationship. You need to be able to do what you want when you want and often act spontaneously. 



It is important to you to be honest with other people and to show your true self. Do not let anyone lay a guilt trip on you. Others appreciate your motivation and the fact that you never allow yourself to be a burden on anyone. You accept responsibility yourself if one of your risky ventures fails. You like to fight and are determined. You make your way through life alone. You were probably left on your own at a young age and were not offered much of a feeling of security in your childhood.

Your acute physical awareness tells you when you have eaten enough and when you need a change in diet.



If you live according to your needs and emotions, you could find yourself indulging in material comforts and consuming compulsively. You may become covetous, overweight and trapped in a monotone life that restricts your freedom.



Your childhood was loving and caring, you never had to complain about a lack of attention or security. Your parents may have spoiled you, making you sometimes appear demanding. Use your abilities to provide yourself with a protective environment and enjoy life. Your relationships are probably lasting which will eventually give you the self-confidence to be spontaneous and take risks. You will find that it pays not to try to plan everything in life.

    <Text>The Moon in Gemini can vary. You may sometimes feel torn between two options because you have the insight to understand the emotional implications of both. You often cannot decide what it is you really need. You crave contact and communication with others, but often avoid opening yourself up out of fear of being trapped. You may not really find peace until late in life. You let yourself be distracted too easily and find that you have tried everything but have no real accomplishments to show for it. Your natural curiosity leads you to a lot of new experiences but often prevents you from taking the time to really digest them. Learning something new and making yourself understood are two things that make you happy. You are able to impress people not only with hard facts, but also by using your imagination and eloquence. You like to express your emotions and talk a lot about yourself. You also notice immediately if someone is keeping something from you that you should know about. You communicate with sensitivity, which you often use to end disputes among others. Your friends come to you with their problems because you always have an open ear. It is important for you to learn to listen attentively to things you would rather not know about.



Your childhood may have been turbulent, filled with changing influences, which challenged you intellectually but did not make you feel secure enough.

    <TextId>Your Moon in Cancer</TextId>
    <Text>The Moon is found in Cancer, where it rules, making it a strong influence in your horoscope. It will express itself differently according to your emotional contentment. Your emotional well being is more dependent on your childhood and family ties than is the case with other people. If you were overprotected and had to fight a domineering mother as a child, you may never become independent and may still rely on childish tricks to get your way. You can be defiant and insistent about getting what you want, because you never learned to share. You may make the same mistake as your mother and not let go when a cycle has come to an end. You feel useless when you do not have any one who you lets you take care of them and tolerate your suffocating them with your "love".



The Moon in Cancer can also be pleasant. If you find inner harmony you can give love and attention to others like no one else can. You create a protective environment and let your partners know that they can rely on you. You use sensitivity to find out what is going on inside others and do everything you can to help them. Your self-confidence comes from deep within you and cannot be easily taken away. You are well balanced and radiate steadfastness without trying to prove anything to others. You are happiest when everyone around you is doing well.

    <Text>You probably fall in love often, you tend to be emotional and always want to feel that you are alive. You like to spend time with others and fall apart if you do not get enough attention. This makes you dependent on other peoples' feelings. Try instead to really like yourself, even though you already give this impression. Your emotional state is very complex, but you have a lot of love to give. Everyone around you is aware of what you are going through because you never found it necessary to make a secret of your passions and feelings. Rejection confuses you and makes you wonder what puts others off. Your resolution and your self-confidence can make others fear being encompassed by you.



Probably you lacked nothing in your childhood. Your parents may have consciously or unconsciously raised you as a little prince or princess. If you experienced the other aspect of Leo Energy, and were oppressed or tyrannized then you probably lack self-confidence today. Once you learn to accept yourself together with all your faults without waiting for the reaction of an audience, you will graciously take on the problems of those around you.

    <Text>The Moon can feel uneasy in Virgo. Our emotions have nothing to do with perfection and cannot always be explained rationally. You can fight off all irrational emotions by tooth and nail and refuse to express negative feelings. You may be keeping to yourself and avoiding anything unpredictable to evade being touched by any kind of passion. If you succeed in closing yourself off you will stifle yourself in solitude. You should recognize your own value and start to accept yourself and not be so critical of your faults.



You may have been raised to be a perfectionist, not allowed to make a single mistake. Your parents may have given you physical comfort but no warmth and understanding. This makes it hard for you to show your feelings and begin a relationship today. You may feel restricted and battle illnesses that are expressions of your suppressed emotions.



Once you have found inner harmony and are secure and satisfied, the Moon in Virgo will show its other side. You will know exactly what you need to secure your own happiness and will not let yourself be confused. You sacrifice yourself for those around you and take great pleasure in helping people. You find joy in simple things and are especially sensitive to your body's signals.

    <Text>Your greatest desire is to live in harmony with your feelings. You need to be loved and are prepared to do anything for your partner to make peace and balance. You are sensitive to conflicts and negative energies and get nervous and depressed easily. You run the risk of becoming too dependent on what others think of you and basing your own self-image on their acceptance. The only way for you to find emotional stability is to learn to love yourself. 



You crave harmony and usually get along well with everyone, if you only resist the temptation to evade conflicts at all cost. People like you because you are willing to help others even when it is to your own disadvantage. You work well in teams because you have learned the art of compromising and are open to new ideas. You love art and have a good taste and a sense of style. You are attracted to beauty. Your artistic and aesthetic development was encouraged in your childhood home.



It is important for you to take a firm position, even if it is at the cost of peace and harmony. You can develop your self-esteem by reminding yourself that perfection in human relationships never existed and never will. Permit yourself to initiate a conflict to protect your interests.

    <Text>Your greatest challenge will be to keep your temperament under control and to withstand the trials of passion. You are capable of feeling deeply; depending on the foundations of your emotions you can love beyond all limits or develop a passionate loathing. You must learn not to give in to your feelings because they contain explosive potential. As you mature you will find that you are better able to control your emotions and will no longer give in to every temptation.



You long to live out your passions and could lead an active sex life. You are open to new experiences, recover from deep wounds quickly and are ready for the next adventure. You feel obliged to bend rules, overstep bounds and break taboos. This does not necessarily make you well loved by all those around you; still you are appreciated for making things happen. Be careful not to go too far, do not ignore pain you may cause to others or you may find yourself lonesome someday, even if you consider yourself a loner and avoid attaching yourself to larger social groups, do not underestimate the importance of your friends.

    <Text>The Moon in Sagittarius makes you want to take on important goals and explore the meaning of your human existence. Your higher principles bring you to search for a religion that is right for you. It could be that the search is more important to you than reaching the goal, nothing appeals to you more than an adventure. You love the feeling of being able to let go at any time and will not enter a binding relationship until later in life. The world is a challenge for you; explore it. You love your spiritual freedom above all else and hate nothing more than fanaticism and dogmatic rules. You go through life confidently and are anxious to see whatever the future has in store for you.



If you have not yet found inner harmony because your parents placed too many restrictions on you or if they simply were not available, it may be difficult for you to act tolerantly towards others who have a different opinion. You have the tendency to waste time fantasizing about the future instead of working on solving the problems facing you here and now. Your responsible nature will help you get your feet back on the ground during this lifetime.

    <Text>In the sign Capricorn the moon is in its exile, for this reason it will not be easy for you to get emotional satisfaction. You do not like to share your feelings, perhaps out of fear of getting hurt. You appear to be cool and unfeeling although you need more security and support, more than others would. In the worst case, constant frustration or even depression could result, turning your heart into shambles. If you could learn to open yourself up even a little bit and accept your own weaknesses it would be a help to you. Instead, you are discontented and bitch at everyone, which is no wonder considering your loveless childhood. Probably you were forced to grow up and accept responsibility at an early age and were never able to live out your play instinct or experiment in a secure environment. Now you do not take any risks with unpredictable human emotions, but suppress them as well as you can. You are very careful, take everything seriously and lose yourself in solitude. You should try to contact your innermost self and develop an interest in other people. Recognize your own value, then your sense of worth will attract others who will show their affection for you.

    <Text>The Moon can feel a little uneasy in Aquarius because it tends to be a little impersonal. As an air sign, Aquarius is more concerned with intellectual ideals than with warmth and feelings. You may try to satisfy your need for love and security in a larger group of people instead a deeper relationship with a single person. Do not exaggerate your participation in various activities, it could merely be a diversion you designed to protect yourself from letting people to get too close. You are probably afraid that friendship might result in giving up your freedom or having to make compromises.



In spite of this you never lose interest in getting to know people and exchanging ideas with them. You set high standards for friendship for yourself and are able to demonstrate extraordinary solidarity with your friends. In your attempt to melt into a group and sacrifice yourself for a higher cause, you will probably find that you rise above the rest. This realization will soon make you proud. During your childhood you were probably intellectually stimulated by humanitarian ideals. You were allowed to show your individuality although on the other hand you had to share your parents with a lot of other people and rarely had the feeling that they were there for you.

    <Text>The Moon feels very much at home in Pisces, because its qualities can be well expressed here. You will more likely have to watch out that you are not driven by your feelings alone that can have bad consequences. You have an active imagination and no fear of showing your emotions and opening up to others. Sometimes you revel too long in a dream state forgetting the reality. You are sensitive, honest and understanding, but not always live responsibly. You can get so involved in the problems of others that your own disappear, forgotten, into the background. Your capacity to take on other people's problems is so great that you should practice maintaining a distance in order to prevent losing yourself. You can be happy artistically channeling your imagination and inspiration without obscuring your vision of the reality around you. Allow yourself enough selfishness to say 'no' on occasion.



If your mother personified Pisces characteristics and sacrificed herself to take care of you, she encouraged the development of your sensitivity. Seen negatively she may have been trying to protect you from the problems of the cold cruel world and that softened you.

Sometimes you face difficult consequences that have long-term effects on your life. Under some circumstances your reason could be subjected by your emotions although logic warns you of this danger. Maybe you should not react so sensitively to the critical remarks of others.



Your private life and your family are extremely important to you and you devote yourself increasingly to the areas of life centered on nutrition and health. You want to practice healthful nutrition based on the latest findings and you invest a lot of effort in researching studies on the subject.

Do not neglect the development of your artistic talent, even if you were placed under heavy demands in your childhood. Sensitivity and remarkable feeling for tact contribute to your reputation for friendliness. Probably you find relations to the opposite sex fulfilling. Because of your ability to understand all sides of an issue, you are often asked to serve as a mediator. People consider you to be generous, but this brings with it the danger of being deceived or used because you cannot say no. Be aware that no one can completely avoid conflicts because they are a normal part of life.

Otherwise your frustrating experiences will put you in an awful mood and prevent you from attaining your goals. In relations to the opposite sex you may be inclined to jealousy if you do not watch out.



If you let things go too much, it could become dangerous for you because your activities will have no reasonable basis. It could be that you are completely lacking in sensitivity. Work on your self-control because only when you work for a cause boldly and with determination you will achieve anything that will give you cause to lean back in your armchair completely satisfied.

On the other hand, your love of comfort and luxury could damage your reputation in this respect. "Everything in moderation" should be your motto. This is why you should not work up your emotions to the point where you see tragedy or immortal love everywhere you look.



Your constitution is resistant and can tackle illnesses before they get started. This is practical because you take on large assignments. Although Jupiter is a lover of travel, you prefer to stay at home on your couch resting on a pillow and not leave your loved ones behind.

Sometimes you seem depressed. If this should be true and if it remains over a long period of time, it would be advisable to get involved in activities in which you are able to have more fun. On the other hand you should have an ample rational faculty and are able to maintain emotions for a long time. The dominant qualities can be determined by the house positions of the Moon and Saturn as well as their aspects with other planets.

No matter where you are there is always something going on because you make sure there is action. The past hardly concerns you at all, because it is much more interesting to paint the future in bright colors. Your imagination conjures up some unusual ideas, although if you are not interested in whether they will ever be realized or not. Endurance is not one of your strong points, you let yourself be distracted much too easily. Your childlike curiosity leads you to wonderful adventures, which you should be able to survive without too much injury.



It could possibly be good for you to take on some responsibility once in a while and to reign in your compulsion to be free. If you are subject to frequent fluctuations in your mood, do something about it. Generally, you should not have very serious problems, mostly because you have friends you can rely on.

You tune into the moods of the people around you intuitively and are known for your sympathy. Still, your openness makes you vulnerable. For this reason, you should choose the people you trust very carefully. You may have psychic abilities. Whether they are useful or are merely products of your imagination depends entirely on whether you have developed an adequate sense of reality. You should not withdraw into your dream world to revel in emotions or you will risk losing contact to reality. Devote yourself instead to nurturing your artistic and musical talents, you could use your imagination for phenomenal self-expression.

Your will power is strong enough to let you influence others, but avoid using it for your personal advantage. If you take a look at Astrology or other esoteric fields, you will recognize that there are goals that serve the well being of humanity, and are therefore worthwhile pursuing.



Your greatest strength is your ability to start again from scratch. Having made peace with the past, you can concentrate your attention completely on the present without the slightest fear of taking risks. This is because you know that this is the most effective way to expand your horizons. Pluto, which is linked to the principle of regeneration, provokes unusual as well as significant experiences in your life, but only when necessary.



Your early awakening may have been traumatic, or maybe you moved a few times. Watch out that you do not put people under pressure by trying to dominate them, this will only end in rejection. Even if it is difficult for you, you should try to express your creative energy rather than your negative character traits.

The message is clear: Let go and do not turn back.



Your emotions mislead you and spoil your plans. It would be better to proceed in a sober manner and put your logic to work until you have developed more emotional security. Otherwise, you will have to deal with family conflicts that will overwhelm you and may effect your metabolism.

Your emotional state can turn somersaults, making it difficult for you to keep the necessary distance to your problems. Even your thoughts can fall under too strong influence from your emotions, so that you will not be able to analyze crises and find a way out. 



Possibly you live according to out-of-date traditions which prevent you from getting closer to people who have a different outlook on life. The people who choose to stay in your immediate vicinity have to take a lot because you tend to release your mood swings out on them. It would be better for everyone if you concentrated your energies on constructive pursuits. Do not waste your time on self-pity, even if sentimentality does keep you from developing rational thought structures. It may be a strain on others to have to listen to longwinded and superficial stories about your private affairs; they may even be driven away. Try to take life a little easier and do not worry so much.

In the course of your life, you may have acquired unhealthy eating habits and especially eat too many sweets. It is true that you are searching for harmony, however, as long as you have not made peace with yourself, you will remain unsuccessful.



Your parents may have been too strict and could not tolerate warmth; this is evident in your reluctance to share your emotions with others. To get a grip on your dissatisfaction, take a closer look at your childhood. This will probably give you the key to your current emotional state. 



Free yourself from the influences of other people and live independently, this will present you with plenty of occasions to learn responsibility; but first you will have to overcome your laziness.

Humor is when you laugh anyway! You should hang this saying on your wall because a dose of laughter would help you develop better composure.

Actually it is nice to be able to make decisions without pondering long, but it is essential to have internalized at least the basics of moral behavior. If that does not work, you probably have difficulties relating to people because you either let yourself be cheated or you brag about abilities you do not actually have. Maybe you will find a job where you can help people in difficult situations. If you do not become too apathetic about taking care of your own every day obligations, you will achieve routine and order with time. Reasonable eating behavior would be a great advantage to you.

Your relationship to your parents could be or was intense because the Moon represents the mother whereas the father is associated with Saturn. Do not let your feelings be too fixed on the past. Bitter memories can make it impossible to achieve satisfaction here and now. However, such situations can be overcome even if you make a depressive or aggressive impression on others, who consider long and hard encounters with you should still have a place on their agenda. If you continue to isolate yourself, you will eventually find yourself in a dead end street that will be difficult to get out of. 



It is imperative that you let go of your past. It never did anyone any good to concentrate on digging up memories to the point of losing sight of the positive aspects of the present. If you take this advice, you could develop an image of yourself that will allow you to be seen with others.

When it comes to new friendships you are not picky, and often they do not last very long. This could be due to a restless childhood, in which you may have moved from one place to another and often changed your caregiver. Your love of adventure consumes a lot of time and energy and also distracts you from your obligations. This may cause some of the people you love to leave you suddenly. Hopefully it will not be too late when the fine day arrives when you return home and finally decide that you no longer want to be alone. It would be a great help to you if you were to develop some continuity in your behavior and maybe even tame your obsession with freedom.

    <Text>You are in a position to transfer your inner restlessness to everyone and everything around you. In this manner your many visions can create confusion, it could even reach the point where your perception of your own personal situation becomes distorted. Watch out that you do not let yourself go too much or you will work yourself up into emotional chaos. The tendency for people who want to flee reality is rising, which is why you should be careful to limit your intake of drugs or alcohol. Also avoid questionable money transactions. As an alternative to drugs, make use of your psychic abilities, even if there is a danger that your ambitions are illusory. Once you have recognized and understood the potential for difficulties in your life, you should be capable of expressing yourself creatively.



The process of decision making is generally left to your subconscious. This is why you are often uncertain whether you should look for the root of your problems within yourself or in others, such as others may try to monopolize your energy for their interests leaving you feeling used. Make an honest effort to further develop your talents and bring stability into your life. This will enable you to set your own goals independently from others who may not be acting in your best interest.

    <Text>Dominating your family and friends and tyrannizing through rotten moods are some of your favorite behavior patterns. You are often so temperamental that people are afraid of you. If you should be remembered in someone's last will, it could bring about a family conflict.



You have a natural resentment against every form of authority and hate to follow orders, which is probably why you will have trouble at work and in dealing with people in general. When making decisions you should not necessarily listen to your feelings, because they are simply too intense and are unjustified. Try to respect the feelings and free will of others. If you do not watch out, you could turn into an ill-tempered person whom it is difficult to get along with.

    <Text>You are making things difficult for yourself, because you prefer to revel in the past than to face the present. This is a specific karmic aspect, because the Moon, which is associated with the past, forms a conjunction with the southern Moon Node and thus tells us what we have to let go of. The message is clear: let go and do not turn back.



Your emotions mislead you and spoil your plans. It would be better to proceed in a sober manner and put your logic to work until you have developed more emotional security. Otherwise, you will have to deal with family conflicts that will overwhelm you and may effect your metabolism.

    <Text>Often you find yourself thrown off balance and have difficulty expressing the cause of your dissatisfaction to others in a way they can understand. Your emotional state can turn somersaults, making it difficult for you to keep the necessary distance to your problems. Even your thoughts can fall under too strong influence from your emotions, so that you will not be able to analyze a crisis and find a way out. 



Possibly you live according to out-of-date traditions which prevent you from getting closer to people who have a different outlook on life. The people who choose to stay in your immediate vicinity have to take a lot because you tend to take your mood swings out on them. It would be better for everyone if you concentrated your energies on constructive pursuits. Do not waste your time on self-pity, even if sentimentality does keep you from developing rational thought structures. It may be a strain on others to have to listen to longwinded and superficial stories about your private affairs; they may even be driven away. Try to take life a little easier and do not worry so much.

Possibly you lack a sense of responsibility which may result in your sympathizing with people you hardly know and may act as an invitation for others to abuse your trust. This may also effect your intimate relationships and may be harmful to your partnership. Your parents may have been too strict and unable to tolerate warmth; this is evident in your reluctance to share your emotions with others. To get a grip on your dissatisfaction, take a closer look at your childhood. This will probably give you the key to your current emotional state. Often you let others influence you, even when it is detrimental to you and contrary to your interests. Become independent of the help of others and learn to live independently, this will open up many possibilities for your life.

    <Text>Do not let your character deteriorate into a state of emotional instability, because you become quick-tempered, which is not an acceptable base for building and maintaining satisfying relationships. You may perceive the situation subjectively, which is precisely why a flood of anger threatens to build up. The best would be to learn to control this within the course of your lifetime.



Probably you pretend to be more independent than you are, although you insist on remaining unattached and fight every threat to your independence with tooth and nail, whereby you often create problems where none exist. It may be due to the prominence of conflicts with your parents during your early childhood, which may be having a negative effect on your character and your professional progress.



Apparently you have problems with self-discipline. If you have not made an effort to incorporate sufficient relaxation into your life, then you need not worry if one day your stomach goes on strike, especially if you are guilty of the other extreme and have been suppressing your worries.

You may love to travel but have trouble choosing a destination. Otherwise you have bad eating habits, which you notice every time you stand on the bathroom scale. Problems with your basic convictions may stem from the differences in religious and moral views between you and your parents that reach back into your childhood.

    <Text>If other factors in your horoscope do not provide you with balance, you will have a pessimistic outlook on life and appear cold. Your relationship to your parents could be or was intense because the Moon represents the mother whereas the father is associated with Saturn. Do not let your feelings be too fixed on the past. Bitter memories can make it impossible to achieve satisfaction here and now. However, such situations can be overcome even if you make a depressive or aggressive impression on others, who consider long and hard encounters with you should still have a place on their agenda. If you continue to isolate yourself, you will eventually find yourself in a dead end street that will be difficult to get out of. 



It is imperative that you let go of your past. It never did anyone any good to concentrate on digging up memories to the point of losing sight of the positive aspects of the present. If you take this advice, you could develop an image of yourself that will allow you to be seen with others.

Steadfastness is not your strong point and activities that always have the same routine will not arouse your enthusiasm. Wait and see if life offers you opportunity to channel your interests in other activities. Probably you will have to be free to do your own thing, before you can stop complaining about the present conditions.



The material situation of your childhood and youth will not have left you with a feeling of stability, maybe you moved from place to place. This might also have resulted in a lack of satisfying friendships because you are always in search of unusual events. A compelling desire for social renewal finds expression in your moving orations on this topic.

It could be difficult for you to lead a stable, independent life, but invest all your energy into it.



Possibly you are due to inherit a large estate, which will relieve you of your responsibility to earn your own way through life. This would be a shame because you could put your ability to recognize problem areas to good use in a creative profession.

This may account for your lack of trust and your inability to open yourself up emotionally to anyone. Even if you still prevent any interference with your life, you should try to talk to your parents about the earlier problems, especially with your mother. Try to get your hot temper under control, get a better grip on your life and do not let your feelings guide you in every decision; they can be deceiving. Although you want to let go of the past, you should not make the mistake of avoiding every kind of commitment.



With this aspect you should have some kind of psychic power, which makes you reject everything worldly. Insignificant details annoy you, because you want to devote yourself exclusively to important affairs. If you could be a little more patient, you would find that everything would go a lot easier.

Always use reason first, to avoid overreacting to distress by doing things which you will regret later. Your ambition should be to live in harmony with all your emotions and instincts so that you can let go of the past and finally allow new horizons to open to you.

    <TextId>Your Moon in the First House</TextId>
    <Text>Lunar energies influence you more than other people, so much more so that it will be noticeable to others. The essence of your being is characterized by your strong intuition and deep feelings. If the Moon is free from challenging aspects you should be sensitive and open to impulses from your surroundings. Sometimes your way of approaching things is somewhat naive, but your intuitive intelligence lets you do the right thing at the right time. You can recognize opportunity and your extraordinary ability to feel and respond to vibrations lets you know when it is better to hold back.



The Moon as the principle of conception and motherhood expresses itself in the first house by a desire to melt into the surroundings. This makes it necessary to counter by choosing to remain distant. It is important to you not to concentrate your energies on reacting to your environment out of fear of being alone, but to clearly define yourself and become an independent individual. Do not believe that simply by screaming loud enough someone will come running to fulfill your wishes. You should have already reached a point where you learned to sort out and interpret impulses from others. All in all, the Moon in the first house presents you with the task of maturing and overcoming childish behavior.



Be careful not to be too subjective and use your analytical reason. You can get so caught up in what is happening to you, your emotions, and hang-ups that you are incapable of perceiving life and those around you objectively. For this reason humanistic Astrology calls the first house, the test of isolation. The way out is to learn to give and take.

    <Text>The Moon in the second house is not responsible for increasing material wealth, but concerns itself with emotional stability or the resulting instability. This gives you an emotional relationship to the physical world.



The Moon induces taking in and accepting, which leaves you with the tendency to believe everything you hear. Your family may have influenced you in this respect. Maybe you are known for your sentimentality in identifying with memorabilia and your inability to separate useful artifacts from useless junk. Your fascination for family heirlooms, antiques as well as for all sorts of mementos could expand because the Moon also establishes a link to the past.



In addition, the Moon is the fastest moving body in the heavens. This can be expressed in the second house by fluctuating economics.



You probably work in a profession that has some relation to the Moon, for example in public service, nutrition, education or something related to real estate. Your colleagues appreciate your flexibility and the way you respond sensitively to the needs of all your co-workers.

    <Text>You are so receptive to the thoughts of the people around you that you have had difficulties distinguishing between your own convictions and the ones you hear from others. It is also difficult for you to maintain distance in some situations and to discipline your rational thought processes because you spontaneously react emotionally. Everyone agrees that you let yourself be swayed by emotion. It would be best for you to concede, accepting your way of dealing with reality. Your feelings determine how you are going to perceive a given situation. Your moods can be as inconsistent as the phases of the moon. The positive aspect of this is that you can relate to nearly everyone you talk to on a personal level and express your sympathy sincerely.



You are very imaginative and have a phenomenal memory. If you approach a science such as archeology or ancient history you should be prepared to stick with it even if you let yourself be distracted and give up easily.



When communicating you express your emotions with every utterance. You could probably write expressive poetry or heart-wrenching stories. In any case, people will love to listen to you once you get your stories structured.



The relationships to your siblings are probably very important to you. Especially your female relations will have influenced you, because you felt safe with them and experienced compassion which you were then able to pass on to your brothers and sisters.

    <Text>The fourth house is the Moon's natural home. This explains why you cherish your family as a source of peace and security. You want to be sheltered and cannot understand how some people are impatient to free themselves from the constraints of their parent's home.



You will remember where you came from your whole life and your parents will always play an important role in your life. You are looking for harmony that is seldom found in the world. If you got little attention or were never sure of your parent's trust, it will have more devastating effect on the course of your life than it would for others. You will be more determined to start a family and provide the emotional security that you were denied. Unfortunately, it is a difficult problem to solve because in such a situation it is all too easy to repeat our parents' mistakes.



You have an especially close relationship to your mother, which you should loosen a little if you want to avoid neglecting your own family. It is important for you to achieve independence and toughen yourself up for life out in the world.



It is possible that you may start a long and drawn out search for a place where you would like to settle down. You may find peace near a body of water.

Your creative endeavors are unrestrained in a way which few can accomplish. You should encourage this talent in yourself; the resulting feeling of individuality makes you pleased and content because you do not have to fight for it. The people around you would love to finally come into contact with you.



You probably want to have children. The moon stands for motherhood which everyone wants to experience in her own way, independently of its house position. It is important to remember that raising children is an invitation to repeat the mistakes of your parents or to fall into the opposite extreme. The fifth house represents the child in us. Because the Moon keeps the past alive, you could be harboring the same feelings for your children that your parents held for you. This problem can surface in a romantic relationship as well.



You are like a magnet to the people around you; meeting people is spontaneous and natural. Use your creative potential and your playful nature for art and music.

The sixth house concerns itself with health and with prophylactic measures to stay healthy. This explains why you are sensitive to signals from your body. It may go so far as to cause physical sensations upon entering a new situation or when meeting new people. You have a special talent to transform these perceptions into useful information. Your health and fitness depend on whether your mood swings hinder your capacity to organize your daily affairs.



The Moon's aspects in this house will tell how you go about solving your everyday problems. There may be a relation to how your mother managed her daily chores. Pay attention to diseases that occur often in your family. Watch what you eat and drink, you have a tendency to compensate for emotional conflicts by uncontrolled consumption. For you it is especially important to live in harmony with your physical needs.



You want to include your emotions in your professional life. You would rather prefer to work in a field with people every day, than standing alone in a laboratory. Your colleagues will not overlook your emotional nature, but you should guard against prying too deeply into their personal lives.

Take a closer look at your relationship to see if you are not actually looking for your mother; the Moon represents the mother. You may catch yourself repeating childlike behavior in your relationship and can then see the problem in a more realistic context. Do not let yourself be molded into a mother role and avoid doing the same to your lover. The goal should be self-reliance and independence. In spite of this, you naturally crave for a stable relationship and the feeling of security and participation.



The ever-changing nature of the Moon can express itself in your quiet moments in which you sense a deep conflict between your individuality and your desire to melt with your lover. This can annoy you and cause you to question the relationship.

    <Text>The eighth house is devoted to the occult and spiritual topics. With the Moon in this house, you are naturally open to the hidden powers of the universe, which come into play in your personal life or in the open. On the other hand, economic factors are brought up, for example other people's material resources. You may have the ability to foresee societal and economic developments.



As a child you were probably receptive to signals and nonverbal communication, especially to your mother's subliminal emotions. You should liberate yourself from these feelings, if you have not already done so. Make sure to guard your current relationships from this kind of complication. If you want to definitively solve these problems, do not go digging up your past.



You probably started thinking about death and sexuality in your childhood, which had a strong influence on your character. Your primary requirement in a relationship is a dependable compensation for your daily battles. You can be very generous and sympathetic to your partner. These capacities are not only helpful in romance but also in dealing with people in other situations.



If the Moon receives challenging aspects in the eighth house, the end of your relationship could take a dramatic turn. Do not forget that a collapse is always unpleasant at first and causes a lot of pain, but that these crises allow us to grow.

Intuitively, you sense the spirit of the age guiding morality and can even foresee future events. You can interpret symbols or old ornaments with understanding and imagination. Even if your rational thoughts do not get you anywhere, you are able to feel the solution and rely on your instinct. You will take on your family values, but do not be timid about questioning these values from time to time and reforming them when necessary.



If you should feel a strong urge to live in a foreign country for a while, you should go for it. The Moon in the ninth house will provide you with ample opportunity. When you have finally gotten on your way it was probably due to a strongly emotional decision or from fantasizing about foreign cultures. Be careful that you do not use travel, dreams, or the occult as an escape from reality. Meditation in a Buddhist monastery may not remove all of your worries.



The nurturing principle of the Moon expresses itself in your capacity to share your knowledge with others. Beware of seeing yourself as a guru, who inspires his followers and gives them insights and hope, but does not place enough emphasis on maintaining self-reliance.



People of the male persuasion may have a special fascination for foreign women, or be drawn to women from whom they can learn a lot without having to submit to matriarchal structures. You will never willingly give up your freedom.

    <Text>Since the Moon in your chart is in the tenth house, you probably adored your father above everything. The trained eye will not overlook that your facial expressions and gestures are similar to your fathers. As a child you were dependent on his affection and may be susceptible to sacrificing your ambitions to care for him. Certainly, this is nothing terrible, but you should eventually distance yourself from your father in order to lead an independent life.



You have been taught to believe that feeling secure is dependent on what you do for a living. Furthermore, you will make sure that you are respected by those around you, because within you there is a small child craving love and attention. Challenging aspects from other planets to the Moon in the tenth house could call attention to other aspects of your personality, which reinforce the desire for approval.



You are able to perceive communal vibrations, so that the emotions of large gatherings of people can manipulate you. You may choose a profession in which you need the tender, beneficent Moon qualities to care for people. In any case, you will always remain true to your profession.

You like the feeling of being a part of a group, an organization or a circle of friends. You should be careful which groups you join because you are inclined to be too open and be too uncritical of your friends.



You like to take care of your friends and also expect to be taken care of on occasion. You have managed to maintain some friendships since childhood or adolescence. Try to remember if they involved frustrations, which may have resulted in the development of strategic behavior that may disturb your interaction today.



You use your free time to tank up on energy and receive emotional approval outside the family and the office. You especially like to help out with charity work and feel at home with the organizations. You need to feel that you are reaching a lot of people with your activities and therefore are prepared to sacrifice.



If the Moon receives challenging aspects in the eleventh house, you could have problems with relations to women. The cause may be unresolved conflicts with your mother, which resurface with your female friends. On the other hand a Moon with harmonious aspects points to friendly relations with your mother which allows you to get along well with women.



Pay attention to two things: Do not let mood swings cause you to change your life ambitions too quickly and listen carefully for signals about your own personal needs and do not ignore them.

    <Text>This Moon position gives you a reputation for being mysterious and exotic. Your sensitivity enables you to absorb the atmosphere, causing your feelings to flow into those of the people near to you. Dreams and visions play a large role in your life. Reality may slip by you unnoticed on occasion leaving the impression that you are not all there. Unfortunately you are easily influenced. Your challenge is to use your sensitivity wisely without opening yourself and becoming too vulnerable. It may help you to withdraw from outside influences and take time for introspection. You could also confide in a friend. This may help since you take in a lot but seldom express yourself clearly.



You may have an intensive but unconventional relationship to your mother. As a child you were emotionally attached to her and still are in a way, even though you are becoming increasingly independent. Your dreams may tell you more about the bond you had with your mother even after her death.



This Moon position endows you with the capacity of compassion for the downtrodden. You may choose a profession that takes you to places where you have the opportunity to help the socially disadvantaged.



In spite of your sincerity, you have your secrets, which you share with no one. It may be a romance that is not supposed to be discovered. In any case it makes you even more interesting.

    <Text>From the Earth, the planet Mercury seems to travel about as fast as the Sun. This is an illusion. Mercury orbits around the Sun in approximately 88 days. Its distance from the Sun is 59 million kilometers. With its diameter of 4840 kilometers it is smaller than the Earth. Mercury can be either a morning or an evening star. In a horoscope, it can be at most 28 degrees away from the Sun, so that the only possible aspect to the Sun for Mercury is a conjunction.



In Mythology, Mercury or Hermes served as a messenger to the gods, responsible for conveying news. His intelligence and his silver tongue allowed him to become the god of commerce. He enjoyed cheating others so much that thieves and other "riffraff" honor him as a god. In Astrology he represents our ability to communicate, analytical reason, business sense, common sense and wit. As morning star it is associated with the sign Gemini, as evening star with Virgo.

You can force others out of the way without even realizing it.



Sometimes you react in a hectic manner and are impatient when something gets in your way. Learn to cooperate and to make compromises if you want to be more successful.

You notice concealed motivations of others and easily uncover hidden details; it is not easy to deceive you. Although it would do you good to learn to take defeat constructively instead of losing yourself fantasizing about retaliation.

    <Text>You tend to lose yourself in grandiose thoughts and overlook important details. Your thoughts center on societal development, justice, morality, and philosophy. However, you can lose sight of the connotation and start building castles in the sky. Detached and abstract trains of thought are more your style than concrete, detailed analysis. You have great ambitions, the fulfillment of which depends on whether you can manage to think realistically enough. You try to recognize the connotations of societal influences and fight for everyone's freedom of opinion, although you have a tendency to present your opinion dogmatically, backhandedly dismissing the arguments of others. Guard yourself from intellectual arrogance; do not let yourself lose touch with the common people.



On the other hand, you can be extremely tolerant and respectable. As an esteemed member of society you would do anything for social development. You would do well in education or politics. You sometimes have premonitions about events of global importance, which enable you to adapt to the new developments quickly. You do not mince words but voice your opinion clearly, whereby your sarcasm sometimes hurts others.

You always secure your position and never take an incalculable risk. Your power of concentration keeps you goal oriented in spite of obstacles. You have perseverance and abide by proscribed conventions. You most likely have completed a conventional course of study and have no interest in alternative projects.



You could reach a high position in this society and are easily impressed by status symbols and trophies. In conversation you are reasonable, it takes a long time until you give in to an emotional outburst. You are not exactly the most entertaining person, but you have plenty of other qualities. You are reliable and keep your promises. You never lose sight of reality and you can bring others down to Earth, should it be necessary. You should still try to develop your sense of humor and not take everything so seriously.

You use your mental energies to become the initiator of a new, more humane society, disregarding proscribed norms. People tend to like you because of your sense of humor and radiant energy. You seek conflicts on a high intellectual level. You feel most at ease when you are able to express your individuality, because you are very lively.



It is your ambition to relax outdated structures and bring about more modern thinking. You know that it is high time for essential reforms. It could be that you are too demanding and expect too much from the establishment, but you definitely are on the right path. You detest deception and become furious when your environment fails to recognize the sign of the times, holding tight to tradition. You will have to develop more patience. You can approach topics easily and are not offended by criticism that was not intended personally.

    <Text>Mercury does not feel at ease in Pisces. The foggy atmosphere here inhibits clear thinking. You like to let your wishful thinking color your perception of reality and then make decisions that defy logic. Usually you are lead by a feeling. Success and failure depend on how well your intuition is functioning at the moment. You are aware of great passions within you, but these are usually too vague to allow concrete goals to develop. You should find an honest and reliable counselor who could get your head straight. Pay special attention to language, express yourself clearly, otherwise misunderstandings are inevitable. You do not have to interpret all the events happening around you according to their relation to yourself, some things happen which have absolutely nothing to do with you. 



If lyric and prose move you, you should definitely follow up your interest and get your thoughts down on paper. Your writing may intrigue others. You will get a better grip on your life when you start taking a hard look at reality, even if you will never be an Einstein.

People usually get along with you because you have no problems making compromises. It would be too stressful to always insist on having your way. Work in the background is easier for you than standing in the limelight. People appreciate the way you follow up your words with action. In dealing with others you are charming and diplomatic and mostly use your abilities for humanistic causes. Maybe you are a writer or work in some other area of communication. You like to spend time with others and your radiant presence makes everybody feel good. This carefree and easy life will be reflected at work, even during those phases in which you cannot make yourself comply with regular procedures. It may be better for you to break off and go into business for yourself; be confident that you can do it.

    <Text>Even with your sharp intellect and mental capacity, there are some questions you cannot answer. Conflicts often arise in connection with your volunteer work for causes, which are especially important to you. This is because you often defend your opinion vehemently. This aspect is especially advantageous for work in the area of journalism and in research, because you love to stick your nose into others people's business. You say whatever you feel like saying, making it possible for you to make clear decisions and stick to them. Just do not get too impatient, or you will find yourself fighting your battles all alone.



Out of interest in politics and social affairs you are frequently found among people who love discussions and are prone to giving long speeches. You are not one to avoid disputes because wherever Mars is in the game there is competition involved. The confidence provided by your extensive knowledge makes you glad to share it with others. However, you should keep your feeling of intellectual superiority under control.

At work these talents help to provide the support and cooperation of your co-workers. The primary concerns of humanity, as they are represented by Amnesty International and by environmental activists against the planetary climatic crisis, are also your concerns, which earns you respect and admiration.



An exploratory expedition out into the great wide world has long been an ambition of yours, which you should definitely realize. With some appropriate professional training, you could go into the field of tourism.

Reason and common sense will not let you raise your voice without having considered the issues first. Your studies are comprehensive and well structured. You have the endurance to work intensively over a long period of time. A pronounced understanding of form and structure combined with your mathematical abilities makes you especially suitable for a career in architecture or engineering. On your way to realizing your intellectual ambitions, expect some difficulties and prepare to take time out for relaxation and compensation. This will combat symptoms of nervousness, as would a healthy sense of humor. Occasionally reconsidering your outlook on life should prevent you from becoming overly critical of new developments and will give you more tolerance in dealing with people.

You can intuitively differentiate right from wrong and usually find yourself at the right time and place to make connections that later prove to be advantageous. Still, do not let yourself get too overzealous and make a habit of setting unrealistically high goals. There is a real danger that you could suddenly change your mind and create a lot of confusion.



A deep interest in esoteric fields awakens your longing for a better understanding of the fundamental structures of life. You could probably achieve this if you devote yourself to the study of Astrology.



Mercury represents all the areas of communication, while Uranus is concerned with developments in electronics. This aspect could give you an inclination to choose a profession dealing with electronic communications, especially in light of the rapid expansion of this field in conjunction with the increasing role of computers. A never-ending search for new experiences frequently puts you in a position to present offbeat solutions that result in recognition of your colleagues and your boss.

Sometimes you are quick to overshoot the boundaries. Even when you are right, try to express your thoughts clearly and use understandable language, this will prevent aggravation and misunderstandings. When dealing with the concrete demands of everyday life, you prefer alternatives to the logical approach. This causes chaos in your environment. Your interests have been oriented on mysticism and esoteric fields that may have inspired you to write.



Constant daydreaming should have an effect on your poetic, literary or other creative talents. Also photography fascinates you. In a group, you tend to embellish your narratives to the point where you are forced to avoid going into any kind of commitment. Instead of debating issues, you just do what feels right. You can be secretive which holds the danger of letting you slip away into your dream world and losing all contact with reality.

Due to your remarkable subtlety in solving the most complex problems, you are especially suited to research, or criminology. Maybe you want to acquire the wisdom of esoteric fields, whereby you should not put yourself under pressure and should try your hand at Astrology. Once your interest has been aroused you will certainly be able to produce papers on this topic. Take care not to let your arrogance get out of hand while you are putting your proposals into practice.

As a creature of curiosity, always wanting to know more, even if you do not have professional qualifications in the classical sense, you have a good feel for future developments and the role you are destined to play in them. Communication with others is important to you because you learn a lot of important things that way. Never remaining fixed on your own way of thinking, your flexibility lets you meet people half way. This saves you many frustrating experiences. 



The relationship between you and your brethren should be warm, which is important to you. Contact with them lets you see things a lot clearer.

Watch out that you do not end up isolated in a world of illusion, because you tend to over-intellectualize your dealings with others. A dose of empathy for others never hurts anyone.



Even if you usually make a regal and independent impression, deep inside you feel a need to bond with people. For this reason it would do you good to allow yourself to get deeply involved with another person; otherwise you may remain lonely. Although before making this type of statement, it is necessary to consult your entire horoscope.

You like to run off at the mouth, although it is absolutely not necessary to antagonize people, because with your intellectual capacity, you should be able to make compromises.



Possibly, you are too skeptical and conservative in your way of thinking. Being under constant time pressure can cause you react in an oversensitive manner. In your rage, you sometimes hurt people's feelings without realizing it. Accept the fact that not everyone enjoys a confrontation as much as you do. Make more of an effort to listen to the arguments from the other side. It would be even better if you could manage to be more understanding. First of all, learn to recognize both sides of the coin and do not interpret a difference of opinion as a personal attack.

Also, it helps to break larger tasks down into smaller steps, set realistic goals and accept the fact that although this is somewhat less exciting, it has more potential for success because it allows for a more efficient use of your limited organizational capacity. Basically, your thinking is not always realistic and your self-image could be more objective. Frequently, you exaggerate your abilities and end up feeling overburdened, which can be critical when others find out that your enthusiasm was not sincere. Be more reliable and think about the consequences before you engage in long speeches. This will increase your success and earn respect and appreciation for your efforts.

That is a good reason to get up the courage to smile at your reflection instead of scoffing at it. If you can restrict your tendency to complain and be intolerant you will soon be able to take part in what is going on.



Achieving recognition for your intellectual accomplishments is often difficult because competition on all levels of the free market economy as well as the social welfare state demands unconventional strategies for success, which seem for you very difficult to come up with.



Before you sign a contract you should either seek professional advice or thoroughly investigate the details of the agreement on your own, otherwise you are likely to overlook the fine print. Also avoid agreeing too quickly, even if the agreement appears to contain advantages for you. Take care of all your affairs and keep things in order to avoid letting misunderstandings distract you from proceeding as you have chosen.

Although you are an original thinker and stay mentally active, you can change your convictions suddenly and create confusion. Sometimes you are mentally removed and draw conclusions that you have not thoroughly considered. You are probably spontaneous, due to Uranus's character.



Because people spend a lot of time in groups and are dependent on social contacts, you should be careful not to insist that everyone share your views. At least you should respect other people's opinions because everyone has a right to free expression. This attitude may turn people off who find you arrogant. Finally, do not take yourself too serious and try to get your eccentric behavior under control.

Although you have a talent for sensing the emotional state of others intuitively, you seldom put them to use because you are so busy fighting your own battles. You should really try to use your positive qualities constructively instead of succumbing to the temptation to escape from reality.

In making decisions, you may be torn between the pros and cons of the issues and not be able to follow one direction consequently. Make an effort to take part in the events so that you are informed and can discuss them. That could change your mind, revealing a better way. Try to get in on discussions and devote yourself to good literature that will make you more critical of your ideas.

You love discussions and debates, but you should know that a certain amount of tact would be useful. Because diplomacy is not exactly your strong point, you should make an effort to cultivate a feeling for tact, at least minimally. Also, do not take yourself too seriously. There are people living on this planet who have other opinions and have the same right to live as you have. Before you make a decision you should review all the facts, listen to various opinions on the subject and consider all this carefully.



Make an effort to be more patient and to listen better to what others have to say. Your views may not always be free of inconsistencies and even if you are thoroughly convinced it may still be that others have different opinions.

Possibly your childhood contributed to your tendency to place limits on your imagination and lose yourself in details. When you do have good ideas, somebody will usually claim them as their own and rob you of the credit.



In your sexual relationships jealously does not play a large role. Your fear of change gives you an inclination to cling to tradition. It is difficult for you to be content with your accomplishments, which is why you always expect criticism. If you should ever attain an influential position, you could make a habit out of criticizing other people's ideas and denying them the recognition they deserve.



Be fair with yourself. Exaggerated self-criticism can become so extreme that the sight of your reflection in the mirror can cause you to burst into tears. A more optimistic outlook on life could help you to get a better grip on your daily work.

There is a stubborn and rebellious side to your intellect that can cause you to be rejected by people who find your attitude overbearing. The matter gets complicated when you start rapidly changing your opinions on everything and are unwilling to listen to any kind of advice. An overnight transformation could throw your life into turmoil because you are constantly on the lookout for exciting and unusual experiences. The ethical values of your behavior are only of secondary importance because you consider yourself to be above societal norms. Finally, do not make yourself out to be so important that you suppress your responsibility to keep your obstinacy under control.

Confront other people's convictions and accept their right to have a different opinion, because everybody has their own truth.

    <Text>You could have a hard time openly confronting people and conducting an honest conversation. It is not easy for you to pull your head together and judge the situation objectively. Possibly you resist logic and get yourself into unpleasant situations. Business sense is not exactly your strong point, which is why you should consider every large transaction carefully. You may think that your education is insufficient; why have you been putting off compensating for your deficiency?



Mental clarity comes from the exchange with others. Use communication to tackle any problems that may arise or you will be handicapped in your life's journey. Be more diplomatic even if it sometimes feels awkward. Take the challenge and look for contact to others.

    <Text>Mercury's qualities of communication and intellectual consideration will not do you any good alone in your room. They should be put to use among people. You may be able to incorporate your capabilities in this area into your profession. You could work in publishing or in retail for media and telecommunications products. You could also distinguish yourself by solving logistical problems. Your profession is very important because you sharpen your intellect and judgment. You want to be recognized for your rational faculties. You feel flattered when your intellectual capacity is praised.



The tenth house is associated with the father and will influence your image of him. If he made an intelligent and cosmopolitan impression, you may have tried to imitate him as a child. He pointed out the advantages of a good education and made sure that you had good teachers and were taught to articulate well.



If Mercury would receive challenging aspects in the tenth house, it could lead to conflicts with your parents, especially with your father, which you should clear up in the coming years.

    <TextId>Your Mercury in the Eleventh House</TextId>
    <Text>Friends and activities within organizations have helped you to see yourself and the world in its larger context. You do not like to work on problems in solitude, but prefer to join people with similar convictions who can expand your horizons. You appreciate other people's suggestions and work on finding ways to improve social conditions.



Possibly you will join a group based on a common belief or a similar view of the world because you are convinced that people actively committed to change can achieve more when they band together. Your commitment to the members of your group has created an intimacy that makes you want to represent the group's interests in public. Just watch out that you do not ignore the interests of individual group members, this could provoke conflicts.



If the planet Mercury receives challenging aspects in the eleventh house, you may be inclined to burden your friends with the responsibility you should carry yourself; either that or you continually give your right arm for your friends and wind up feeling used. Stay in touch with your siblings, they could become your best friends.

    <Text>Mercury in the twelfth house of your birth chart evokes unusual thoughts. The sooner you confront everything you run into the sooner you will understand. In the twelfth house, Mercury is trying to establish a connection between the subconscious and the conscious. You should start to explore the depths of your soul. But do not lose yourself in it to the point of neglecting your daily responsibilities. You could try to get through to your subconscious using meditation techniques and find out what kind of powers can be drawn from it. It may be worthwhile to dig up what is hidden there and put it to use. There may be other things that are best removed from your life.



Your mind will run into difficulties recognizing its limits. The twelfth house is the house where the ego melts. Your thoughts could get mixed up with your surroundings, which will probably be confusing.



You could make positive use of the energies of the twelfth house. If you have the possibility to support others, then you should not hesitate to do that; you may find that you are more relaxed and may be able to earn a living at it.



Protect yourself from negative thoughts, for they are the root of many problems. If you succeed in organizing your thoughts and imagination without losing contact to your friends, you may find that what you thought was a barrier is a blessing.

    <TextId>Venus - The Way of Loving</TextId>
    <Text>The planet Venus requires about 224 days to orbit the Sun. It is about the size of the Earth. We can often observe Venus with the naked eye because it shines like no other planet. Like Mercury, it can be either a morning or an evening star and can be maximally 48 degrees away from the Sun, producing the only possible aspect to the Sun, a conjunction.



The radiant beauty of this celestial body caused Venus or Aphrodite to be honored as goddess of beauty and love. After Zeus threw his sperm into the sea, she arose having been born of foam. Her beauty did not only bring harmony, but provoked the Trojan war. In Astrology, Venus stands for everything that we find beautiful and desirable. Its place in the horoscope tells us about our requirements for peaceful, harmonious surroundings, our love life and our ability to sacrifice. The arts, especially music, are associated with Venus, as is our sense of aesthetics and our preferences in the art of seduction or being seduced. As evening star Venus is associated with the sign Libra, as morning star with Taurus.

When you find someone appropriate for you, you do not let go easily. You may have problems with your jealousy. You tend to want to own your lover and suffer from separation anxiety. If this is not the case, your partner can depend on you. You are not the type to play around; you take relationships seriously and are too complacent to want to instigate a strenuous adventure.

You pay close attention to your appearance, enjoy grooming and dressing up. If you are out to catch someone, you are unusually patient and offer a variety of enticements. You like to give flowers because they make you so happy. Taurus's connection to the throat often means a full, melodious voice; you should try singing sometime.

If you want to convince someone that you are in love, your coddling will get them. You are extremely curious and always want to know what people are wearing and who is sleeping with whom. You should take care not to get lost in superficialities. Your insatiable curiosity, in spite of its sparkle, has the negative quality of causing you to become bored quickly. An occasional change of pace is very important to you. You approach strangers with ease. You are not the type for intense, serious relationships, but when you have gotten caught up in one, you can be faithful. It is easy for you to express your true feelings. This is why you demand honesty in a relationship. You have a weakness for the aesthetics of language and may enjoy writing poetry. You may also like to dance.

Sometimes you feel off balance, this may be dependent on the phases of the moon. You should first strive for your own independence before entering an adventure like a relationship. You develop a dependency quickly and may even let yourself be oppressed in a relationship. You do your best to avoid fighting with you family, although it is not always constructive. Do not let yourself appear weaker than you are, but discover your limitless capacity for love and make it a gift to someone close to you.

The opposite sex is attracted by your charm and your pronounced femininity or masculinity. Once you have found a partner you can remain faithful and be very tender. You are good with children, so a happy family life is definitely not beyond your reach. The people you love get to know your generosity; you try to read their wishes in their eyes.



You love to be the center of attention and are insulted when you are overlooked. Instead of wasting your energy preparing grandiose appearances, initiate creative projects.

You never neglect your responsibility to your family. The way you care for those around you serves as an example for others. People know they can rely on you. It should be possible for you to be a little warmer in expressing your feelings. Be aware that your children need more than a perfectly organized daily routine. They need warmth and to feel close to you. Do not be too strict if your high expectations are not always met. Some things are better overlooked.

You love parties and all other kinds of social occasions, because these give you the opportunity to meet people. Your appearance and charm makes it easy for you to approach strangers. You take great care in selecting your personal style, clothing and furniture and find that your efforts beautify your surroundings. You are knowledgeable about the arts and may find career perspectives in this area.



Harmony is very important to you. You cannot stand it when people around you fight or use rough words. You will not be able to get around developing your determination and protecting your interests in the face of resistance. You can give others a lot, but only if you are good to yourself. You do not have financial problems to speak of, because you attract money and have a good eye for finances.

    <Text>Venus in Scorpio presents the challenge to keep your passions under control, to keep yourself from being eaten alive by them. You love under the principle "everything or nothing" and also expect your partner to give his or her all. Traditional astrology tells that you have a tendency for secret affairs, sexual excesses, jealousy and revenge. You have to decide for yourself if this sounds like you.



You have high expectations of a relationship and look for perfect fulfillment. You can easily give yourself to your lover and expect the same in return. Sexuality is very important for you because it helps you to overcome inner limitations and tap new energy sources. If your lover is unfaithful you are so devastated that you end the relationship. You usually are not in good standing with previous partners; once you have separated from someone, you do not grieve long over the lost relationship. That is the contradiction in your character: your relationships are very intense, but you quickly come to a point where you can put a definitive end to it. Just as quickly you find someone new. The erotic appeal heightened in flirtations that are more important to you does not go unnoticed. Extraordinary people interest you more, even if the contexts in which they draw attention to themselves are not always positive.

You endeavor to realize all of your ideals in the partnership. Hopefully you are aware that this is no easy task. Your cheery disposition and positive outlook will open a lot of doors for you, but not enough to satisfy you. Your search for spiritual truths leads you to sisterly love and social development.



You demand absolute honesty in a relationship. You can lavish affection on your lover, but once in a while you see around your rose-colored glasses and devote your attention to everyday responsibilities, otherwise you could wake up to a nightmare.



You usually abide by the traditional morality, unless Venus has an unpleasant aspect, you are able to tolerate all forms of peaceful coexistence. You tend to excesses in your aesthetic taste, like dreaming about installing a chandelier on your living room ceiling, but somehow you manage to get away with it.

If you do lose control and give in to passion, it is an exception. For you a relationship means security and stability. You can also communicate this to your partner.



You are certainly not trendy; you much prefer classical art forms to modern forms of expression. Your outward appearance is probably oriented to conservative taste. A splash of color or a different pattern could provide more life to your outfit. You prefer the company of educated people who have status. Hopefully you do not go too far and become a snob. It would do you good to let yourself be a little more open and casual. On the other hand, people know they can rely on you when they need your help.



You may tend toward older partners, who make you feel more secure or are drawn to offer security to younger people. In either case, you can bond intimately and become a rock of stability for your partner.

Anyone seeking a long-term relationship with you will have to accept that and be prepared to live their own life. You despise dependency and jealousy and find your own form of harmonious coexistence. Your views on love, sex and marriage probably are not accepted by the majority. A good friendship is more important to you than eternal love. Your relationships can end just as suddenly as they began.



You probably have had a lot of affairs and fall in love often. Your unconventional attitude can easily confuse your partners. Your own instability does not make things any easier. You can only work for a cause if your whole heart is in it. Your associates notice it too, and let themselves get caught up in your enthusiasm. You would much rather be part of a large group than spend your lifetime in dedication to one person. This may come out of fear of letting anyone get too close.



You prefer modern art forms, because Uranus has a connection to technology and electronics. You like to listen to techno music.

What you would like the most is to melt together with your beloved or to dissolve in your emotions. You are prepared to give yourself completely and expect the same of your partner. Romance plays an important role in your relationships, you want to chase and be chased. If you have not yet found your center you will want constant confirmations of acceptance making yourself more vulnerable than you are.



You are very sensitive and have great understanding for other peoples' burdens. If you are able to help someone out, it makes you feel good. You can let yourself be used, because you do not always see the interrelations realistically. You can get involved on all social levels, running the risk of overloading yourself. Take care that the strain does not affect your health.



You are probably a creative person with an active imagination, inspired to actively create. If you have not done anything in this area, it is high time to let your hidden talents come to the light. Do not forget to take care of yourself, too, and do not give up your dreams. You could lead an emotionally satisfying life.

This aspect may primarily have a sexual significance, but it does not mean that its energy cannot be used for other purposes, especially in the areas of art and music. Social welfare is also an area of special interest to you. In light of the deplorable state of affairs, you could be torn between deep sympathy and an attitude which allows you to ask yourself "is this my business?"



Because you love life, you should try to keep a lid on the aggressive and stormy potential of Mars, which is easy to hold off by its connection to Venus. The principle of love, symbolized by Venus, has a physical emphasis due to its connection with Mars, which actually should not be dominant. It would be nice if you could keep these two powers in balance.



Maybe your financial resources are in a bitter state. It may be necessary to keep careful track of your credit cards because you tend be too generous. It would be advantageous for you to learn to be a little more careful with money. This will save you aggravation.

As a token of support for people who are not as well off as you are, it is important to you to donate money to worthy causes.



The principle of harmonious love can combine with Jupiter's expanding tendencies to develop diplomatic abilities that enable you to mediate between people on several social levels.



Comfort and luxury are important to you, but that does not mean you have to throw your money out the window. If you want to bring out the positive qualities of this aspect and be able to greet others with kindness, you will receive the acknowledgment and respect you need.

If you should discover a scientific field that arouses your interest, it could very well lead to successful employment. You probably place a lot of value on working independently, because you can concentrate better.



A pronounced sense of fairness and solidarity has helped you to remain largely free of prejudices. Occasional shyness does not prevent you from making long-lasting friendships. The ability to recognize problems as they are developing supports your day to day struggles.

You know how to enjoy yourself and are a welcome guest at parties and other events, because you usually think of some way to pleasantly surprise others. Spontaneous creative urges find expression in the arts whereby you emphasize your originality and cannot call enough attention to it.



Your charitable attitude has become such a part of you that you are no longer able to free yourself from a feeling of responsibility for the entire human race. This is certainly praiseworthy, but may overwhelm you. In erotic relationships, you sometimes give your partner the impression that you do not know what you want. Today, you are head-over-heals in love and tomorrow already searching for a new erotic adventure. This may sound extreme, but may not actually be so obscure. Sometime during the course of your life you should develop an appreciation for long-term relationships.

Your level of maturity is the most important factor in determining whether you will be able to develop realistic ideas or if you let yourself slip off into a dream world. If you ever find yourself in a position to use this aspect positively, it will help you to find true love. Because you are imaginative and receptive to all forms of beauty, your presence is enough to make others happy, feel tranquil and at ease.



Being attractive can have positive or negative effects; these will largely be determined by your motivation. The problem in it is that you may be quite gullible. Someone promising to bring you the stars down from heaven can take you in. Watch out that you do not get cheated. Basically, you are a good person, but you should not assume that everyone else is.



Maybe mystical sounds have an influence on you or you are artistically active in some form or other. Because all activity relevant to capturing pictures on celluloid is under Neptune's influence, you could feel drawn to photography or the film industry.

Whenever the planet Venus plays a role, creative artwork is the result; in your case it will probably take the form of acting. As mentioned previously, you should not let your sexual passions go completely unrestrained. The tremendous creative energies you have been given will provide you with a path that will lead you away from an abyss of love and passion. All you have to do is find it.

Support the development of your creativity by devoting yourself more to art. In this area you are capable of substantial achievements because you know how to express hopes and wishes. Any conflict in your proximity inspires you to try to reestablish harmony. This is possible only through your own inner tranquillity. Continuing to work toward this goal is the right way for you to attain your ambitions and leave the past behind you.

Probably, you were the apple of your father's eye, although both of your parents were proud of you which means you should guard against becoming your parent's prestige object. Romantic relationships are important to you and will help you to acquire a high standing in the course of your life; later you may be a magnet for wealth.

    <Text>This aspect may cause emotional problems especially in your partnership because your potential for love and aggression do not harmonize with each other. Sometimes you behave as if the only purpose for a partnership were to satisfy your sexual desires, an attitude that upsets your partner. Maybe you should work on developing tact and get a grip on your instincts in order to take better care of yourself. Although you are emotionally very sensitive, this does not necessarily make you aware of the vulnerability of the people around you. This can cause conflicts and other difficulties.



Possibly, Venus' ever-present desire to preserve harmony has prevented you from developing assertiveness and from setting clear limits. In this case, you should try to direct your vision on your goals and do not make detours to avoid conflicts.

Especially if you were fortunate enough to have a sheltered childhood, you always expect to be the center of attention and take a lot of things for granted; an attitude that will get you nowhere.



At times you seem to be very sentimental, that is until someone actually expects help from you. Do not give in to the temptation to consume sweets excessively or collect status symbols. If you can manage to take on more responsibility in your everyday life, others will see you in a more positive light.

Develop your ability to judge objectively, then you will be better able to get a grip on your own personal situation. Look towards the positive side of life, get out and meet people, then you will be better able to expect something for yourself.

    <TextId>Your Venus in Opposition with Your Uranus</TextId>
    <Text>This opposition indicates liability. On your search for pleasure, you forget to consider the consequences. Because you are constantly getting involved in new erotic adventures which mean everything to you while they last, you will have difficulties getting involved in a longterm relationship. Try to be more frugal.



Emotional abstinence can become so extreme that you do not even listen to your own inner voice. It is against your principles to listen to advice of others. A strong need for autonomy at any price will make it difficult for you to take on the responsibility of a partnership. Do not be amazed if you feel lonely later in life.

    <Text>Emotionally you are guided by internal energies. Sometimes you hinder yourself in financial affairs, in your partnership and in creative matters. Subconscious wishes can sometimes distort your perception of reality.



Guard yourself against letting your basic dissatisfaction with life and your intense love of pleasurable experiences develop into a drug addiction. This will have financial and professional consequences. Also, the planet Neptune can lead to a tendency to hide private difficulties until things are forced out into the open, whereby your partnership will not suddenly break up, but will dissolve slowly.

    <Text>This opposition brings with it the danger that you will become entangled in intensive emotional and sexual relations, which are not exactly characterized by harmony. Your temperament that you sometimes are not able to keep under control could take a lot out of you. In your partnerships, you insist on taking on the dominant role or encounter difficulties in mutual financial dealings.



Do not let your passions become destructive and try to keep a cool head. If you are dissatisfied, then look for the cause within yourself first. It does not take a prophet to foretell that your life will bring romantic disappointments with it and you should not let frustration carry you away to the point where you give in to self-destructive tendencies.

    <Text>It is difficult for you to show your emotions and admit to your vulnerability. In living together with others, you make the same mistakes over and over again and find it difficult to learn new behavior. Relationships can be robbed of their happiness by your inclination to chase after ideals and avoid confronting the problems of reality. It may be that you have sacrificed your entire identity and all your personal goals for someone else thinking that this is love.



Extreme sensitivity can leave you feeling attacked in situations when no one intended to hurt you. Until you have found inner harmony and have learned to judge relationships realistically, you will have to deal with disappointments. Honest affection can only develop when it stems from an open heart.

    <Text>During the course of your life you will encounter difficulties creatively expressing your personality. For this reason, misunderstandings are inevitable. Sometimes you are unable to tell what kind of people you are dealing with and are a poor judge of their real motives. Maybe you idolize people who have not earned your trust, and are then forced to deal with disappointments. For this reason, you should try to conduct your relationships more realistically. Although you radiate self-confidence, on the inside you are very dependent on the approval of others and prefer to be around people who you feel have already made it.



Maybe the next time you see your reflection in the mirror, you should make it understand that you are ok. Of course this development may take some time.

It is also possible that responsibilities are transferred to you from your closest friends, which get in the way of an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying love life. Still, this serves only as a challenge, which can be overcome in this lifetime with a little discipline and willingness to compromise.

    <Text>This aspect may cause emotional problems especially in your partnership because your potential for love and aggression do not harmonize with each other. Sometimes you behave as if the only purpose for a partnership were to satisfy your sexual desires, an attitude that upsets your partner. Maybe you should work on developing tact and get a grip on your instincts in order to take better care of yourself.



Although you are emotionally very sensitive, this does not necessarily make you aware of the vulnerability of the people around you. This can cause conflicts and other difficulties.



Possibly, Venus' ever-present desire to preserve harmony has prevented you from developing assertiveness and from setting clear limits. In this case, you should try to direct your vision on your goals and do not make any detours for the purpose of avoiding conflicts.

As a female, you may be proud of your looks and your social status and may do anything to attract attention. Avoid excesses and try to lead a stable life.

Take care that you do not turn into a cynic who holds everybody but himself responsible for his fate. This does not imply that you are opposed to working by your own interests.  Especially when it concerns material goods, you can act extremely selfish. Instead, look towards the positive side of life, get out and meet people, then you will be better able to expect something for yourself.

Maybe you are attracted to people of the same sex or have an unconventional sex life. It is important for you to learn that a long-lasting relationship requires giving up a small part of your autonomy because it is not workable without compromises. When you are feeling insecure, like you are on an emotional roller coaster, you should pay attention not to let yourself go too far or you will hurt others. On a social level, exciting activities may come up which you do not always quite follow. Do not take on too much; remember that you are not responsible for the well being of all of humanity. Even if your activities are praiseworthy, you probably load yourself down too much.

Possibly emotional and sexual problems hidden deep within you are destined to emerge out of your past and suddenly come to light. Escape mechanisms send you into a dream world to avoid confronting the demands of life in reality. For this reason, you should abstain from taking any kind of drugs.



In erotic affairs, you are not very particular and tend to get involved in questionable relationships, which can also involve risky financial enterprises. If you are not open and honest in your relationships they will be endangered.



Other people perceive you as being shy and introverted, but you are capable of having secret love affairs, which can occasionally lead to sexual excesses. Seen positively you are creative and have good taste. With the necessary discipline you could be able to put these abilities to use. Sometimes you can be over-sensitive and make yourself vulnerable.

Possibly you act on your passions and are not capable of letting logic take over, even when it seems to be necessary. Interference from supernatural authorities could also get in the way of a happy relationship.



Do not let your wish for material goods become dominant or let your way of dealing with others take on an inconsiderate nature. In all your relationships, money can play a deciding role, although this way of thinking will not get you anywhere. If you have supernatural powers, do not use them in an egotistical way to manipulate your surroundings, especially members of the opposite sex. Instead, invest your talents in the creation of innovative forms of art, this will bring you positive energy as well as the recognition from others.

It requires tact and sensitivity in dealing with other people's vulnerability. In the field of diplomacy, you still have a lot to learn and should do so if you intend to develop further and become satisfied.



Maybe you have unrealistic expectations of living with others and are shocked when a conflict has to be solved or if an argument breaks out. Remind yourself that life cannot always be harmonious and that confrontations can be fruitful experiences.

Find the courage to take action, because as a master of grand words, you will eventually be judged by your deeds. If they are unsatisfactory, then it is time to rethink things. Invest more energy in managing your life, if you are interested in making something out of it. Usually your exaggerated need for harmony leads you to avoid conflicts, even those that could be productive. However, in order to make this kind of statement, it is necessary to take the entire chart into consideration.

    <TextId>Your Venus in the First House</TextId>
    <Text>Venus in this area of your chart speaks for an openness in life. You feel a desire to enter new friendships giving your sensitivity and friendliness a free run.



If you encourage inner harmony and flexibility, you will find out who you are, although a possible outcome is a feeling of internal conflict due to your need to respond to the expectations of others. You should make an effort to really like yourself. Self-assurance and self-confidence are essential to satisfying relationships. If you respect yourself this will have a positive effect on your surroundings and you will find it easier to accept other people the way they are.



Venus in the first house can be interpreted as contributing to an aesthetically pleasing appearance. Even if you are not considered "conventionally beautiful" others find you charming and attractive.



Hopefully you did not give in to your longing for comfort too much while you were growing up. You may enjoy sitting in your favorite armchair and waiting for things to happen without having to invest any effort. It would be better for you to get up and take an initiative.



If Venus is harmoniously aspected then you received a good education that gave you self-confidence and a positive attitude towards life.

    <TextId>Your Venus in the Second House</TextId>
    <Text>Venus in the house of material values provides you with an inclination to acquire all the material possessions that please you. This enables you to decorate your surroundings according to your personal taste. This does not imply that you feel compelled to follow every trend, quite the opposite: you love the timeless classics and have an eye for quality. You love to be praised for this. Naturally there is some danger of drifting off into a dream world of aesthetics which shields you from confrontation with the ugly reality. A simple way to avoid this is by reading the daily paper.



You are polite and objective enough to feel at home in a diplomatic environment. Your character will probably allow you to get a hold of everything you need or value. If you learn to plan of your finances instead of wasting money indiscriminately you will have no financial problems. You should have a lot of artistic creativity. You are especially talented at forming natural materials with your hands. You may be able to make this into your profession.

Watch out that you do not conform your ideals to the point of restricting your individual expression. You love a good conversation and want to be in line with the person you are talking to, whereby you find an aggressive tone very intimidating.



Most people are very friendly to you, because a pleasant atmosphere moves you. If you have siblings, it would be strange if you were not in close contact to them, unless Venus is challengingly aspected in this house.



You probably experienced school as a joyful time of acquiring abilities. Words and numbers interest you because you have always approached learning playfully and still do. You feel a longing to devote time to deepen your general education and would like to express yourself in an artistic medium.

    <Text>You long for peace and tranquillity in your family. You cannot stand conflicts and always try to work out a solution. To promote this you have created a relaxed home which you enjoy redecorating periodically. Be aware that open conflicts are a part of family life. It is better to confront them than to have undercurrents of concealed aggression, which are not permitted to rise above the harmonious surface.



Venus stands in relation to the images you have made of the central people in your life or your views of everything which you find beautiful. Your mother may have provoked this projection onto herself. Earlier, she may have made you feel competitive or distrustful because you felt that you could never get close to her. If you are male, you may have fallen in love with your mother and made your father your rival.



You are capable of changing this because Venus in the fourth house is an indication that your family has a good financial and emotional standing. Even in your old age, you will not have to worry because you will have the financial means to live the way you want to. You may be one of the fortunate who had an artistic influence in their childhood.

In unpleasant moments, following your imagination and artistically expressing your emotions especially helps to clear your thoughts. Unless a challenging aspect to other planets prevents it, the expression of your individuality and your radiance should touch those around you.



Love may be the most important thing in life for you. You can take pleasure in romance like no one else, although it may include tragic situations. Sometimes you do not take it as seriously as you should because the fifth house is the house of play.



You also like to go to cultural events such as exhibits or concerts, because you can meet people and like to be seen.

You experience deep satisfaction and happiness only by sacrificing yourself for your relationship. This provides you with the approval you need to recognize your talents.



If you love someone you will help her to develop her qualities and become important to her. Simultaneously, you will have higher expectations than anyone has a realistic chance of meeting. You are responsible for your own disappointments. Make more of an effort to avoid putting pressure on your partner and to think before you criticize. No love affair is all sunshine. You are going to have to learn to accept burdens and restrictions as part of a happy relationship.

You love to travel. If life does not grant you ample opportunity, you should devote more energy to it.

Maybe you will try to further your career by joining a group that promises to be useful. Groups devoted to improving the world interest you the most.

You long for a beauty beyond reach which promises ideal fulfillment. You will look for love and beauty in someone else and then submit completely in the relationship. You expect a lot from your lover and harbor a feeling deep within you that you are missing something if you give your love only to one person. This may express itself in an elevation of your love to a higher level that allows you to share your love with more than just one other person by loving all of creation and sacrificing yourself. Potential lovers can then only be of secondary importance.



On the physical level, Venus tells of the relation to specific institutions. You may work in a gallery, a museum, a hospital, a home for the elderly or a similar institution.

    <TextId>Mars - The Will to Survive</TextId>
    <Text>Mars orbits the Sun in 687 days. It is smaller than the earth and has a diameter of 6800 kilometers. It is known for its red color that has always been associated with aggression. For this reason Mars is honored as the god of war, called Ares by the Greeks, who was renown for his courage and bravery and threw himself into every battle. Traditionally, Mars symbolizes the warrior who has to till the fields in time of peace to feed his family. Mars symbolizes the male and Venus personifies the female energy. Fortunately, it is becoming increasingly difficult to work with these outdated concepts in Astrology. It makes more sense to equate Mars with our energy drive, which both men and women posses in some form. Thus, Mars stands for assertiveness, drive, aggression, courage and also for sex drive. Mars rules the sign Aries as well as together with Pluto, the sign Scorpio.

Unfortunately, you often do not have enough endurance to work through to the end; halfway there you get interested in another project. You let yourself get excited and can get others caught up in your enthusiasm. You do not let anyone tell you what to do or even offer well meant suggestions. You want to do things your own way, are usually in a hurry and overlook important details. This means you have to deal with failure on occasion. It would pay to work more carefully and plan and organize your activities before you begin. You should tame your enthusiasm and pay more attention to the feelings of others. Your thoughtlessness can hurt others. You are sometimes angry and even aggressive.



You measure yourself against your competitors. You need a lot of exercise and have the qualities of a good athlete. Maybe you channel your excess energies into sex, because your drive can be overpowering. Your determination to be active can be very useful in life. You should watch out that you do not end up alone at the top.

There is hardly a topic which does not interest you and about which you do not have something to say. You love a heated discussion and do not back away from conflicts. A good fight can even bring you into your best form. Your quick retorts make you unbeatable in discussions; you should listen to the arguments of your opponents more carefully and not resort to unfair means such as sarcasm. You may say things, which you regret later. Some things cannot be fixed with an apology. It is better if you keep your tongue in check.



You spend a lot of energy collecting information for your general education. If you work in the media, your creativity will make you very successful. It would do you good to reduce your interests to a single area, at least for a limited time; otherwise you may end up tired, out of breath and with nothing to show for your efforts.

    <Text>The planet Mars is uncomfortable in Cancer because Cancer stands in opposition to the sign Capricorn, where Mars likes to relax. It is not easy to express your Martian energies in this position because the planet Mars and the sign Cancer have fundamentally different forms of energy. If you find it difficult to get your way, you may admire the courage and determination other people are in command of. As a man, you may be amazed by your strong feminine character traits. Use your sensitivity to overcome the aggressive, empty, self-serving ambitions which other men find fascinating and cannot live without. Do not underestimate women's appreciation of your strengths. Men with Mars in Cancer make the tenderest lovers. Men who do not manage to free themselves from empty macho pretensions, are only making fools of themselves. 



A woman with Mars in this position on her chart will be attracted to men with warmth and sensitivity who are romantic. You prefer to see a man cry than watch him sweat lifting weights. Nothing turns you off faster than a macho idiot strutting his stuff. You need someone who will sit with you in front of the fireplace and talk about having children.

You should ask yourself what you are doing in response to your own needs and what is merely show for others.



You probably have a strong sex drive that expresses itself in romances and affairs. You are capable of passionate feelings. As a man you can tend to gestures of machismo, which can seem exaggerated. Your task will be to keep your conceit under control and be more humble.

You are able to build and destroy as you please and are not free from self-destructive tendencies. You set your ambitions high and want everything or nothing. Mediocrity and moderation are not for you. Your unusual charm will always make people notice you. No risk is too high and no path too dangerous, because you love challenges and are always out to prove your strength. 



The person who becomes your enemy has no enviable position. You show no mercy and are unforgiving. You fight until the end, whereby all means are justified. If Mars has an unfavorable aspect you can be unscrupulous and egotistical, refusing to acknowledge when you have reached a limit. If you have learned from experience and have become more mature you will use your energy to help others and do everything to help the destitute back on their feet.



Sexuality plays a large role in your life. Your energy can be expressed more clearly in this area. Do not let your passions devour you and accept the end of a relationship without seeking revenge.

Still these limitations can also have a negative effect and let frustration cause you to lose control over your behavior. You may feel that your self-expression is being suffocated and may have difficulty keeping your aggressive potential under control, so that it can erupt without warning. Dissatisfaction can develop into a dogmatic and authoritarian attitude. Relax and treat yourself to something enjoyable once in a while. That is healthier than going through life embittered.

    <TextId>Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Uranus</TextId>
    <Text>This aspect denotes the tendency to passionately rush into things, since your freedom means everything to you. Any kind of restriction or coercion makes you rebel. Boredom has no place in your life. You are always looking for new challenges and adventures. You advance quickly, throwing caution to the wind. It is imperative that you take more care of yourself or you could burn out. Relaxation could also be important for you to renew your energy. It would do your nerves and your body a lot of good to regularly go to a sauna.



You are fascinated by modern technology and new developments in the aerodynamics and information technology and follow all the developments with great interest. It would be satisfying for you to work in a technical field and preferably in the area of electronics. If you let your many activities drive you to hectic behavior, this could lead to a tragic accident, which could be avoided by taking time out for a little reflection. Watch out for your reckless driving behavior and try to keep yourself under control.

    <Text>This aspect may bring you extrasensory powers that you will be able to use in support of the less fortunate. Astrology may be an interesting field of study for you, although you may see it as a way to come to terms with the meaning of your own self. A profound spirituality resides within you, which you should handle carefully. It may be that until now your plans have been impractical and useless. If this is the case then you can easily get lost in your endeavors.



Often, people find your actions incomprehensible and some people have no idea how they should deal with you. In your erotic relationships, you often sense desires which even you think are strange. Because you have difficulty perceiving reality as it is, you should avoid mind-altering substances.

    <Text>Large energy reserves serve you well in a variety of activities. Due to your spirituality you are able to tap into cosmic energy sources. Sometimes you take on more stress than others do, whereby you also end up with more to harvest. Courage and your extreme willpower can get you into dangerous situations, which you tend to enjoy.



How this conjunction expresses itself depends on which planet has a dominant position in your chart. If it is Mars, you will have to keep your passion in check, because it can express itself in an unhealthy egotism. If during the course of your life you become more aware of the meaning of your role in the universe and are able to see beyond your national identity, you should also understand Pluto's principle of will and be able to offer your strength to help others.

At first, you seem to be nice and are always polite, but egotistical motives can be lurking underneath this facade. Much of what you do is actually aimed to serve your own interests.



On occasion, you can push your global and social convictions on people around you so aggressively that you intimidate others. If you feel urges to take a trip, go ahead and do it. It will satisfy your thirst for adventure and expand your horizon. Do not get taken in by risky business enterprises.

If you have already let this become a habit, then do not be surprised if people do not flock to support you in your efforts to reach your goals.



Possibly your childhood was marred by conflicts with your parents, whereby one of your parents took on a dominant role and had no tolerance for any kind of contradiction. This could eventually cause you to try to succeed in destructive manner. If you give in to these tendencies, you will only be more bitterly disappointed.



Sometime during the course of your life, if you could manage to be a little more friendly to other people and be supportive without expecting something in return, you will find that this will make it easier for you to reach your own goals.

    <Text>You are inclined to sudden emotional outbursts or look for fights. These mood swings do not exactly encourage others to reward you with their confidence. Often you react with aggression and express your distaste for any kind of routine or discipline.



The problem with this opposition is that you probably will have difficulties developing good judgment. Because of your struggle for independence, it is not easy for the people around you to deal with you in a laid back and easy way. Nothing runs against your will and you may drive your boss crazy with your reluctance to take advice and by insisting on doing things your way under any circumstances. Only painful experiences will be able to convince you to get a grip on your life and change your attitude.



Your life may change suddenly and decisively. Possibly you moved in your early childhood, which may explain your restlessness. Watch out that you are not too unstable and drive people around you nuts.

    <Text>This aspect implies some restrictions on your actions because of the contradictory qualities of Mars and Neptune. This may result in an inability to use reason to keep your behavior under control with any efficiency. Sometimes you may lose sight of the general picture and give the impression that you are disorganized.



There may be a lot of misunderstanding between you and other people. You should be more open and honest in your dealings with people instead of scaring them off with an undercurrent of your driving nature; this is often difficult for anyone else to understand. Once you become aware of the aggressive Martian qualities that probably crop up uncontrollably and make your life difficult, your behavior will be more understandable.



An unusual need for love and tenderness can be traced back to the suppressed wishes of your childhood and sometimes collide with life's daily responsibilities. The resulting frustration should under no circumstances be answered by consuming intoxicating substances; this will put you completely out of it. In extreme cases, the discord within you may manifest itself as an illness.



The greatest problem with this aspect is the difficulties acquiring even a somewhat realistic outlook on life. This is caused by the clouded and unfocused energies of the planet Neptune. Thoughtless action could be the result, which is why you should always take time to consider about what your doing before you take action.

    <Text>Generally, it can be said that this aspect creates discord between your individual drive and aggression, which are associated with the planet Mars, and your will, symbolized by Pluto. You can be very defiant when you are forced to feel the consequences of your own behavior. Sometimes you are not able to keep your reactions in line out of an inability to understand how someone can react aggressively to you, even when everyone else agrees that you pushed things too far.



Sexual passions can be very intense, because you get involved in deep relationships that are turbulent. Watch out that you do not misuse your own magnetism to exploit people, or one day you could become a victim of this yourself. Learn to control your lust for power over others.



It is important for you to consider the pros and cons carefully in everything you undertake, whereby you should not ignore compromise as an option. Take as much time as you need to think about what you want to achieve and be careful to avoid invading other people's space.

It is especially important for you to continue projects that you have started and not jump from one activity to the next, whenever you get bored. Maybe your self-image is so poor that you do not feel adequate to fulfill the responsibilities of society and are unable to work determined and persistently enough. Let time teach you how to acquire a feeling of achievement.



Do not waste the money other people entrust you with and stay away from political extremists. A tendency for excessive and uncontrollable behavior as well as an addiction to spending money crops up in the signs and houses where Mars and Jupiter appear in your chart. It is also possible that you find yourself in a permanent state of restlessness because you are constantly in search of activity and excitement. Relaxation may be a foreign word to you.

In dealing with others, your efforts may not bring about the result you hoped for, especially in relationships to members of the opposite sex.

The planet Saturn can have an inhibiting effect on your activities; still, you should eventually become capable of structuring your life. It is important to make an extra effort to finish all the activities you started, even if you have no desire to force yourself into it. In dealing with your boss, you should not let yourself be provoked to outbursts, devote your efforts to learning to accept day-to-day responsibilities.

In the areas of your life which are represented by the houses in your chart where Uranus and Mars are found, it may come to tense and varied experiences whereby you are even willing to take great risks.



Early on in life you should make a habit of reflecting and staying calm. If you are not able to keep your temperament in check and start rushing into action, it could lead to an accident. This is also the case if you work with machines and electrical appliances. In your search for excitement you could be in danger of mistaking Route 66 for the racetrack in Indianapolis.



Sometimes you are impulsive. Your explosive reactions can hurt people who are not always understanding of your eccentric outbreaks. If you should decide to become more patient during the course of your life and work more with other people than against them, you would only profit from it.

This square can have varying effects according to whether it suppresses or formulates your needs. If, sometime during the course of your life, you have felt inclined to suppress your true nature, it could cause discord within your body, which could manifest itself in an illness. Others may get the impression that your actions are not structured or oriented toward a goal because you let yourself be guided by subtle motives.



If you want to take on the challenges of this aspect, you will have to learn to differentiate your dreams from reality. Otherwise, you run the risk of earning a reputation for being flaky. A more serious study of Astrology may advance your development. This will help you to recognize the context of the various aspects of your life.

Sometimes you act out of an extremist tendency and put other people off with your "all or nothing" attitude. You should take a closer look at the motives behind this attitude. This may all come out of an egotistical need for revenge, because you are sometimes inclined to crazy, unfounded behavior.



Because your will is well developed, you should avoid losing your orientation and appearing insulted by those around you if you do not get your way. You have to learn to keep your temperament within limits or you will have more problems than you will be able to deal with. As soon as you understand this, you will realize your plans with patience, stamina and courage.

This can be counteracted by finding an area of interest that fascinates you and which leads to a feeling of accomplishment.



Possibly you feel compelled to put your energy to a good use, but do not know what to do. Sometimes you behave inconsiderately or are even brutal and refuse to cooperate with others. After treating sexual encounters as sporting events you wonder why your relationships do not last. Someday you are going to have to accept that your behavior is not making you happy, but is keeping you from your goals.

It is important for you to act with caution and to avoid rushing into things. A little discipline could be an important advantage. It will not help you if you have wonderful creative ideas that you cannot realize due to a lack of patience and discipline.

You are going to have to learn to deal with aggressiveness or it may prove harmful to your health. You should avoid taking your aggressions out on yourself and acting aggressively towards others. You can learn controlling yourself by doing physical labor or through sports. Practicing self-defense, which is a method of relaxation, could be of help.



You appear honest, intuitive and open. It is no problem for you to pursue your goals intensely and to take your interests very seriously. Your nature will not allow you to be afraid of making your own experiences and to confront life. You should not wait around for something to happen but take the initiative yourself.



You harbor the potential to achieve your ambitions, which makes it difficult to explain why you ask for help and call upon the resources of other people. Usually you take responsibility for your life and do not hesitate to go your own way.

Take care not to react too spontaneously and tense up because it will negatively effect the results you are working for.



Probably you are addicted to material consumption and want immediate gratification. Your entire personality might be obsessively possessive. When you are forced into venting your aggression, do not take it out on defenseless objects, which will only increase your frustration.



You invest all your energies in a courageous endeavor to keep your values. However, watch that you do not put other people under too much pressure. If money and material possessions symbolize power to you, the consequence may be an attempt to use your successful acquisitions as an expression of your individuality and life energy, whereby you also seek approval by displaying your determination to achieve what you set out to do.

This may also be why you have trouble talking about your feelings or explaining what is happening to you. It may be that you only hint at what is troubling you or rely on subtle body language to convey your message. If you are interested in developing your character and keeping your circle of friends, you should take a closer look at the concept of "tact".



Basically, with your mental alertness and wit you should have no problem learning to communicate. No matter what comes, you always know a good response. Logic, which can be useful when used correctly, could become an ax. Do not ignore its destructive powers.



You choose to confront life's interesting topics and want to discuss or at least write about everything you perceive. This helps you to let off steam.



If you develop an inclination for a nervous or hectic style, practice your self-discipline and work out regularly.

You may burst into an outrage, shocking not only those around you but even yourself. Once you are able to analyze these outbreaks, you should be able to manage to accept your potential for aggression as one aspect of your nature and find a positive expression for it. This will provide you with an energy boost for other things.



You feel no need for public spectacles. Probably you sense vitality in your home and personal life. On the other side you may be inclined to take things out on your family, whenever something is not to your liking. If you think you need to tear about at home, then use your energy positively, such as for cleaning.



You probably found your mother was dominant or testy. Possibly you fought a lot with her in the process of finding yourself. These problems were later solved when you moved out or became more independent.

When you are overtrumped, your ambitious nature challenges you to consider ways to improve yourself. For you it is about winning and losing, not about fairness.



You bring the same energy levels into romance and creative activities. You are highly motivated in your endeavors, whereby a little drama is usually included in the package. Your high energy and talent for motivating others are your most positive attributes. In the arts, your creative techniques may not be the most refined, the works you have produced until now have been very important to you.



You love sports and match your strength and courage against your opponent. You also devote your energies to making love. You are capable of passion that is unequaled. Usually you do not have a long span of attention when it comes to romantic relationships. A few unforgettable hours is sometimes more important than a long term relationship. This is why you have shied away from the responsibilities of a family in the past years. If you should ever overcome your reservations, you could probably get into roughhousing with the kids in the yard.

Your perfectionism makes you take on a lot of responsibility and to be pleased when everything goes well. In a complicated job you see only the challenge. You know how important a well-functioning body is, which is why you are concerned with your health. Some people think you exaggerate in that respect.



You are sure you know how things are supposed to be done, which can be difficult when you are expected to cooperate with others. It is not simple for you to explain your standpoint to your colleagues. It would be better for you to go into business for yourself. Then the only one you would have to deal with is your own reflection. If you were not so biased it would be worthwhile to find out about the advantages of a cooperative enterprise. If you take a few basic principles to heart, you would be a highly valued employee, who is also known for helping out colleagues.



Your motto can be reduced simply to "speed". It would do you good to replace it with "toil in tempo". You are in danger of overloading yourself and ruining your health. Maybe you should learn some relaxation and meditation techniques: It would bring some peace and quiet into your life.

    <Text>With the planet Mars in the seventh house you develop your personality through an influx of energy from personal relationships. Keep your temperament in check or you will scare people off who you only just met.



You could feel drawn to someone who takes over decision making for you. You think that a partnership will make you more independent and help you find yourself. The initial erotic attraction may wear off, and if you do not watch out you find yourself playing power games, which only serve to bring everybody down. Possibly you will not be able to tolerate the domination of someone else and try to regain the control which you willingly gave away.



Mars in the seventh house is not only associated with conflict-laden relationships. It can also lead to a passionate and stimulating partnership, in which you help each other develop without limiting each other's freedom. If you manage to control your inclination to let your aggression out on the people you love most, you will reach a state of relative harmony. The approval you need from others will not be long coming.

    <Text>You have high energy, which is especially noticeable in your way of dealing with others. You do not hesitate to put everything you have into relationships because they simultaneously offer you an opportunity to tank up on energy. The spiritual exchange of energies is your fountain of life.



This behavior also brings dangers with it. If you live out your negative side, you could catch yourself unscrupulously manipulating people in your surroundings and indoctrinating them to serve your ambitions. It is only a question of time until your usefulness has run out and you find yourself isolated. Also, you could divert your arrogance into risky financial ventures only to be left in the end with nothing to live on. If Mars has challenging aspects, your domineering nature could result in difficulties in relationships and social ties.



Sex is an important topic for you. You are a temperamental lover, but you should guard yourself against bringing your aggression into the bedroom by using sex as a means of power or you will find yourself trapped by your own lack of restraint.

At worst, you tend toward religious fanaticism or completely reject contrary opinions. You should exercise tolerance and approach the search for truth more relaxed. Do not forget that everyone has a claim to their own truth, as long as it is not misused as a legitimization for hurting people.



You love to travel and sometimes decide to change your destination spontaneously. Foreign people exercise a great erotic attraction on you. You may find yourself in a relationship with a foreign person. Professionally, you may be a writer, work in publishing or in education. You will always devote some of your energies to learning and probably will not have any negative experiences because your vitality comes from your immense curiosity.

You want your achievements to be recognized and respected. With your stamina, you could reach unfathomable heights. You should be able to work your way from dishwasher to millionaire. Pay attention that your endeavors do not take on an inconsiderate form and bring about situations in which you feel justified in doing anything that will get you where you want to go.



If Mars in the tenth house has challenging aspects, you probably have had a difficult childhood. Possibly you experienced your father as authoritarian and aggressive and were afraid of him. It was not easy for you to cut yourself free from his influence and develop your own ideas. Make sure that your achievements are not actually supposed to prove something to your father. That could strain your relations to your bosses and also serve as motivation for you to achieve a position where you will not have to take anything from anybody. In any case, it would do you good to relax and back away from the stress at work.

But do not forget the interests of the community. A pledge to cooperate does not remove all the problems involved in giving in and taking part in discussions about other peoples' ideas and concepts. You may make decisions alone that are meant to be binding for everyone. Reexamine your commitment to cooperation in concrete cases.



If Mars receives challenging aspects you may want to draw strength from cooperation and hide behind an organization. Maybe your fear of making your own way will leave you vulnerable to anyone offering to lead. Break away from the crowd, stand up and develop your individuality.



Your greatest talent is the way you use your energy to motivate others. You are always coming up with new ideas. You should be good with modern technology and should not be apprehensive, especially when working with computers. You are willing to fight for your friends as long as it does not interfere with achieving your ambitions. That can change suddenly when it comes to sharing or if your goals are at risk. You will then be faced with the challenge of finding a compromise.

In the intervals between, you feel nervous and are not sure why. It is important for you to learn to deal with aggression constructively and to let other people know immediately if something is bothering you. It would also be good to back up a step and take a look at what upsets and frustrates you. If you do not succeed you may develop a tendency for self-destructive behavior, which certainly is not in your interest.



You should generate more energy and put it into living. When something does not suit you, be the first to initiate a change. Take the responsibility for your life and stop wasting your time complaining about everything and falling into lethargy. Your dreams may show you a way out of the mess. If you could create a sense of achievement, which would allow you to recognize your strengths, you would find it inspiring.



Once you have found your strengths, you will be capable of fighting for the rights of others and offering help completely selflessly.

    <Text>The planet Jupiter requires almost 12 years to orbit the Sun and is the largest planet known to us. Its diameter is 143,000 kilometers, making the Earth seem tiny in comparison. Its size and brilliance lends itself to comparison with the Roman father of the gods of the same name, called Zeus in Greek mythology. He takes care of the lesser gods and those people, who submitted to his levying ample expression of respect. He was also known to be furious or arrogant on occasion and had numerous affairs, thus his wife, Hera, was not to be envied.



In Astrology Jupiter signifies higher religious, philosophical moral and ethical knowledge. Its position in the chart tells us how to expand our horizons, because it represents expansion in all areas. Justice, Law and doctrine also belong to this field. In addition Jupiter can offer a little luck. Wherever Jupiter appears, one should be careful not to become dogmatic, arrogant or excessive.

Knowledge of the surface is not enough for you, you long to learn more about the great mysteries of human life such as birth and death. With Jupiter in Scorpio you will not necessarily have any trouble learning more about the world around you. It should be easier for you to share this essential knowledge with others than for other people, once you manage to come out of your hiding place. If you should at some time in your life manage not to identify with the suffering, which you without a doubt, are capable of feeling more intensively than others, you will come out of hiding holding in your hand the key to a satisfying existence.

After you have found a code of ethics that suits your lifestyle, do not try to convert all your friends. They will not be able to understand it as readily as you can.



Your thirst for knowledge will make you a life-long student. You should make use of self-teaching materials and not get hung up on the kind of learning offered at universities and schools. You read a lot and if you can afford it, utilize electronic media, which are constantly being introduced.



You love to share your acquired wisdom with others. If you choose a profession that involves conveying knowledge, you should not encounter difficulties and the financial means should be sufficient.



In Sagittarius, the planet Jupiter is in its home position. If you can keep your tendency to exaggerate under control and not fall victim to your latent play instinct, you should be able to live a satisfying life and feel good about yourself.

    <TextId>Your Jupiter in Capricorn</TextId>

You are well respected especially in ethical and moral matters, enabling you to assume positions of responsibility. Your political and educational views are usually conservative.



You are a very responsible person and pursue your goals with perseverance. If Jupiter has a negative aspect, you may fight all new ideas and accept the majority views uncritically, because you believe it will make you successful faster. You may be exceedingly stingy and honor money as a god. You should know that times change fast and demand new solutions.



If Jupiter receives harmonious aspects, you could keep reasonable concepts ready, which do not end at any country's borders, but may even rise to overcome global challenges. You know what is in the realm of possibility and will not follow illusionary utopias. If you could change your ways and give humor more room in your life, you could achieve a lot.

You could be an intellectual forerunner of the Age of Aquarius, the age following Pisces in which service to humanity is called for. You are convinced that all the inhabitants of the Earth must work together to give the planet a chance.

    <Text>You are prepared to be active for your beliefs and often sense vague longings. You may be very religious and actively participate in your religious community. You would love to be able to work on realizing your dreams of a better world and devote your time helping people who are not as well off as you are. Your concern for others due to your unusual sensitivity leads you to place priority on social work. If you do not consciously keep yourself thinking prudently, you run the risk of letting your altruism be abused and then getting depressed about it. You should help people develop the capacity to stand on their own and not become dependent on your help. Do not make a pair of rose-colored glasses a staple part of your wardrobe. Take them off once in a while and be careful not to drown in your emotions. If you want to truly offer useful assistance to others, you must be able to maintain some distance.



You have a lot of powers that can also be used for meditation. Perhaps you have some type of sixth sense or telepathy. You should make an effort to avoid drugs and set concrete goals for yourself in order to make regular progress in realizing your dreams and ideals. Your sensitivity and imagination can bring you success, especially in the arts.



If Jupiter's aspects in Pisces are challenging, you will have to be wary of false gurus out to exploit your naiveté. You may not achieve independence until later and have problems getting a grip on your life.

    <Text>A totally negative outlook on life may come from strenuous obligations to your family or to others, which leaves you no freedom to enjoy yourself. Occasionally financial problems arise. The challenge is to have patience and continue on your way, determined to accomplish what you set out to do some day. However, until this day arrives your drive and cheerfulness will suffer from daily frustrations. Probably your greatest problem is that you load too much work on yourself. If this is the case, then you should definitely relax; taking regular breaks from your daily worries. After you have recovered you will have more energy for other things.



Continuing education is very important to you because you are convinced that the only way to stay competitive is to keep yourself one step ahead of everyone else. These efforts profit from your remarkable memory because you can keep up on the latest developments.

Especially with your preference for unusual experiences, this could be extremely important to you. Things could develop so as to leave you with an extensive knowledge of esoteric fields. Astrology is a discipline that you should take a closer look at because it involves intuition, a skill that you will not have to learn. Probably throughout your whole life you have been trying to adapt to the conventions of traditional society.

If you do not do something about it, others will start to consider you unreliable. You may not understand their impatience because you always try to do your best and have good intentions. If you can manage to take a closer look at the hard reality of life around you, you will find that the new perspective will help you to manage things better.

Because you can be very generous, you are a welcome guest at every party and festivity. In this manner, you are able to win people's trust, although you should be careful not to promise too much. Sometimes your projects get too large to be realized.



Because the Ascendant is related to appearance and the planet Jupiter represents the principle of expansion, you should try to avoid excessive culinary gratification; otherwise you may be forced to set off in search of an effective diet.



If you should ever get caught up in travel fever, do not hesitate to give in to it. Traveling the world has always been a way to expand one's horizons.

Sometimes you are inclined to take on responsibility that you do not really think you can handle. Learn to make better use of your time, this will prevent many professional and financial problems.



Accept the fact that your fantasy and originality are slightly inhibited, still you can at least try to approach things flexibly. Conservative attitudes threaten to suffocate you in monotony. Although you are determined, you are often unlucky and you may believe that you are plagued by misfortune. Generally, you give in to your fate too easily and accept a strict daily routine out of a sense of duty, although this may force you to neglect your personal goals. If you are not able to bring out your individual talents and to stand on your own two feet, then all that will be left is for you to choose between accepting the situation at hand or putting up with toil and suffering.

Although you are capable of generosity and acts of idealism, you could lose your realistic sense of judgment and let your imagination get so carried away that your grip on reality is endangered. A lot of people have problems with you because they are put off by your inclination to eccentric behavior. Just as they are aware that you often promise more than you are capable of delivering, which does not exactly increase your popularity.



Out of determined passion, you battle against the existing ethical and educational concepts perpetrated by society. Even when you are certain that you are at fault, you defiantly defend your outlook on life. You may have sudden urges to travel to experience unplanned adventures.

It would be a good idea to avoid making promises that you are not sure you can keep. If it goes too far you will gain a reputation for being irresponsible and incompetent. Specifically your problem is a general inability to recognize life's responsibilities and to adequately fulfill them. An illusive view of life only serves to further distort your perception of reality. Outwardly you try to project a spiritual image, whereas you are not capable of becoming objective enough to discriminate within yourself. Sometimes you express feelings of deep sentimentality, but it can really get on everyone's nerves.



Take special care not to follow self-proclaimed spiritual leaders. Demanding worship and reverence cannot be in conjunction with the will of God. For this reason you should guard against projecting aspects of your own egocentrism onto others. The practical experience which life brings to you will make noticeable improvements in your behavior.

If you carry your need to be recognized too far, you will have problems that will make harmonious relationships nearly impossible.



Constant boasting and your inability to appear humble even once are responsible for your lack of popularity. You should pay attention that you do not force yourself into isolation, where no one is really happy.

If you are inclined to speculation, you should take into account that if you do not get it together to think before you act, you run the risk of suffering grievous financial losses. It is extremely important for you to take a close look at the pros and cons before you begin a project and put your investments at risk.



Maybe your restlessness will manifest itself in a desire to go on excursions, to take on challenges or to suddenly break out and see some of the world. You should take special care to avoid exotic sects and other organizations that could prove to be dangerous for you.

Maybe you will feel at home in another country, but you should make sure that you are not trying to run away from yourself.

    <TextId>Your Jupiter in Trine with Your Ascendant</TextId>
    <Text>The planet Jupiter forming a trine to your Ascendant promises you a great deal and puts you in a position to take on your surroundings with optimism and a generous portion of enthusiasm.

All in all, it is definitely a positive aspect to have in a birth chart; still, you should be careful not to take on too much. Occasional relaxation would certainly do you good.



If you should ever get caught up in travel fever, do not hesitate to give in to it. Traveling the world has always been an educational experience.

    <Text>This sextile keeps the concept of expansion and stability in balance. In your professional endeavors, you will exercise caution and enthusiasm at the appropriate times to ensure the success of your plans. The effective fulfillment of your responsibilities earns you the respect of those around you, because you deal sincerely with everyone.



Being interested in life's philosophical and ethical questions, you are able to actively support the people neglected by fate in an intelligent manner, but only up to the point where they are capable of helping themselves. You are no Samaritan; your motto is "helping people help themselves".



An interest in politics has led you to work with political initiatives or to join a party. The ability to stay focused on your goal enables you to develop a perspective in which your worldview includes a vision of a better future.

    <Text>It is possible for you to adapt to the constantly changing social circumstances and to use them productively. You show your interest for new publications of philosophy, including esoteric fields. Possibly you have telepathic abilities.

Optimism and a peaceful way of dealing with people win you a lot of friends and also makes you popular. Your friends like to visit you at home; the originality of your parties is the topic of conversation for days afterwards. Your confidence comes from your drive, which lets you realize your plans and fulfill your wishes.



Being fascinated by new technologies, you have probably started working with computers. Although this is the technology that is developing at the fastest rate, you are determined to keep up.

Art and philosophy are your primary interests, whereby your emotional involvement is sometimes very intense. For less fortunate people you have no trouble feeling sympathetic, but to put your feelings into action you need original ideas, and even more so, a lot of self-discipline. With your sentimentality and your inclination to take the easy way, this will probably be difficult for you. Remember that your guardian angel will take care of you, especially in a crisis. Somehow you will be supported when you need it, whether you have earned it or not.

Spiritual practice may enable you to come into contact with universal energy sources and make your own creative expression possible. It would be helpful to make sure that you are acting in everyone's best interest.



When choosing a partner, you prefer someone who shares your involvement in social and charitable work. Working together, you can relieve a multitude of people of part of their burden.



With enough ideas and inexhaustible energy you are able to proceed in your endeavors and before you can turn around, others have gotten caught up in your enthusiasm and are motivated to help you get the stars down from the sky. The planet Pluto gives Jupiter's beneficial qualities a chance to express themselves and influence the way things are going.

No matter what you take on, it seems to always work out to your satisfaction and allow you to enjoy a higher standard of living. Being open for everything new, you greet people wholeheartedly. Out of interest in the fundamental questions of life, you sometimes begin to philosophize or read more sophisticated books. A study of exotic cultures and the worldviews of foreign peoples expand your horizon. If you are able to resist your inclination to seek comfort and maintain your level of activity, you will achieve your life's ambition.

    <Text>With Jupiter in the first house you enjoy delving into the questions of philosophy. You approach life with optimism anticipating what will happen. This can inspire people who see you as a bearer of hope. Keeping up on the latest trends is important to you. Financial success comes from your feel for development.



If Jupiter has challenging aspects, you can become dogmatic and therefore unable to appreciate the pleasant side of life. You try to force your convictions on others and your intolerance causes you to look down on other belief systems. Do not let your arrogance drive you into isolation and learn to accept the human shortcomings in others.



In general, you should not have any problems getting along with your friends because you seem to generate something which is best described by the word benevolence. You see life as an adventure or as a long journey. Actually, you can spend more time on foreign continents than at home. If you manage to avoid the risk of overestimating yourself, you could be lucky and look back on a very fulfilling life.

    <Text>Probably you have fun acquiring and keeping things, this may make your house seem like it is about to burst its seams. Your drive and energy steadily contributes to your wealth, which makes you happy because your sense of security is very important and is dependent on cash flow. Still, you usually manage to use your resources for sensible things and also share with others. 



You should take care not to turn into a materialist thinker, except in numbers. Maybe you will believe in a connection between religious belief and economic success like the Calvinists, such that the level of your bank account measures how you please God. You like to make your own rules and should avoid letting that harm other people.



In finances, you should actually possess a substantial nest egg and probably simply luck out regularly. You could also suffer from compulsive wastefulness and throw everything you have earned out the window. You can almost always rely on your ability, even in such situations, to come up with an appropriate idea.



Professionally, you could work in the travel industry, in law or in commerce.

    <Text>You want to expand your horizons through constant exchanges with a lot of different people. You are always up for a conversation and find it easy to meet people and listen to other opinions. You appreciate the diversity of opinions and let yourself be convinced by good arguments. You recount your experiences without embellishments. The views presented to you in conversations often inspire you to begin new projects. You love both the spoken and the written word and most likely have a well-stocked library. Intellectual progress is important to you, whereby you appreciate the developments in the media that have brought the world closer together and enable constant, unlimited access to information.

You probably have a large circle of friends and keep in touch with your brothers and sisters.



You may be talkative and have a weakness for gossip. You may approach every topic superficially because your various activities wear you out and you want to avoid taking a stand whenever possible.

    <Text>You will decorate your home stylishly and extravagantly. You would be capable of turning a hut into a small palace. A tasteful environment is important to you, but you should be wary of an inclination to overdo it.



You brought your values along from childhood when your family shaped your intellectual development. Your childhood provided you with a positive outlook on life. You were impressed by your mother and probably still follow her example. She may have first brought you into contact with a foreign culture. Hopefully, your childhood home was not too restricting. If you were not given enough freedom to think and live the way you wanted to, your fear of restrictions may cause you to hesitate to start a family.



Friends are attracted to your house and you are known for your hospitality. You like hosting parties and even let people stay overnight on occasion. This is why you value a lot of space and maybe even have already moved out of the city. If not, your love of nature makes it an interesting alternative for you.

It is constantly in search of anything new, which will inspire creativity and expand its horizons. It takes on every challenge and does not let failure bring it down for very long.



You keep yourself active, without taking life seriously. Your playful nature will engage your creativity and imagination to creatively stage countless love affairs. You do not live by the dry, serious and philosophical Jupiter principle, but prefer to give in to all the pleasures which life has to offer. Your art reveals signs of openness and joy, which is why good-humored people show appreciation for your works. Naturally, you are in danger of becoming decadent, but you could deal with dying from a heart attack at 40 for a satisfying life up until then.



At sports, you give everything and you like to compete. You are good with children and are more than prepared for all sorts of childish nonsense that they are likely to think up.

Regardless of what you come up with, you always want to find a purpose in what you are doing. When you fine-tune your capacities, you will live a satisfactory and pleasant life.



It is important to you to really take pleasure in your work. You would not take on a job below your capacity. Because Jupiter symbolizes the principle of expansion, you could have a tendency to take on too much or work especially pedantically. If you feel used or wait in vain for recognition of your achievements, the negative energy in your body could manifest itself as illness. Illness may be the only legitimization for you to rest or allow yourself to be cared for. Do not set your standards for yourself too high, but enjoy your free time. You should also learn to recognize the achievements of others. You should give up your arrogant dismissal of other people's reliability along with your belief that only you know how everything should be done. Delegate a few tasks and give yourself a break.



In general, you have a good relationship with your body and have a talent for giving appropriate suggestions and helping people onto their feet.

    <Text>You are looking for happiness in your relationships and get into the dilemma of having to sacrifice a piece of your precious freedom. However, you are not immune to jealousy, either. You need a partner who accepts you as you are and appreciates your positive side. Your creativity enriches your relationships and you have a large selection of unusual seduction techniques at your disposal. You want to enjoy love without having to take on responsibility. You may be looking for the perfect partner, who will never be in need of your help, and are denying reality. You may refuse to make a move toward a monogamous relationship out of fear that you could be missing something.



In spite of this, Jupiter in the seventh house tells us of personal happiness in relationships. If you find a partner who is independent and gives you freedom, you are capable of a longer relationship. This will certainly not get boring because you will provide the excitement.



Even on the social level, you should be prepared for all kinds of contacts. It should not be difficult for you to get to know people, because you are open and friendly and make a self-confident impression.

    <Text>Jupiter in the eighth house describes personal expansion through the exchange of resources with others. Jupiter will place a protecting hand over you by making contact to other people's wealth. You may find yourself in a financially profitable partnership, either of a romantic or business nature, or you may come into an inheritance. You can sense financial and political developments and can trust your instinct to invest well.



In your personal relationships, you do not hesitate to place everything you have at everyone's disposal. This is how you find fulfillment and develop. You have an eye for human qualities and can even transform negative qualities into positive.



Getting a grip on your sexual needs could pose a problem for you. Possibly, you have an inclination for extreme behavior; at least you have a strong desire to constantly have new erotic experiences, which in fact do impart insights. Never forget to be considerate of the feelings of your partner.



Any kind of limits present you with a challenge. Jupiter embodies the principle of expansion, and the eighth house tries to overcome and use natural limitations. You may be interested in existential questions, which arouse so much fear in other people that they are commonly suppressed. The depth of your thoughts gives you a mysterious aura.

    <Text>You are constantly looking for insights in answer to your questions about the meaning of life. You think of life as a long journey, which you want to make as interesting as possible. You are always open to new things but never know what is going to come of it. Your optimism should make you popular.



If Jupiter has challenging aspects, you may tend to lecture people and have trouble accepting other opinions. You could lose yourself in complicated theoretical considerations that no one can follow or would even want to. At worst, your behavior could take on a fanatical character and prevent you from seeing reality the way it is. If you are of the opinion that yours is the only valid truth, you will soon find yourself in isolation.



Generally you should be appreciated for your tolerance and openness. Take a look at the world and do not hesitate to spend a longer period of time in a foreign country, it would have a positive effect on your development. It may be in a foreign culture that you find the missing piece of mosaic of your philosophy of life. Never stop learning, which would probably be like brain death to you.



Your ideal profession could be in law, in the travel industry, in education or in publishing.

Generally that will not happen because you have an aura of authority, which could almost be considered majestic. Status symbols and other signs of power are very important to you. You require a certain standard of living.



You approach professional challenges with enthusiasm. Somehow you are always sure that you will find a solution to any problem. That may be your secret to success. You should really start a career and climb to a respectable position. You find fulfillment by accepting responsibility for larger endeavors, which further your individuality. You may have a profession which lets you travel, you may be in law or banking. Do not let the key to personal happiness depend on your social position and do not secretly hold people who are not as successful as you in contempt.



In the tenth house you will meet your father. Probably you found him charming and tried to imitate him and may even have taken over his convictions. He may have first brought you into contact with foreign cultures.

    <Text>In the eleventh house Jupiter will feel at home because it has enough room to spread its ideas. This constellation means that you will approach people without reservations. You will look for a group with similar convictions with whom you can realize your concept of charity work. You may even end up leading the group. You spend a lot of time worrying about the future and want to do your part towards solving a couple of problems and working to make the future brighter. You could have colorful visions of the future that will convince your friends. Even with your optimism, you should not make the mistake of expecting too much, setting yourself up for disappointment and frustration. Do not lose your grip on reality and do not take slip ups too personally.



Your colorful, diverse group of friends and everything you do together helps you to understand larger contexts and prevents you from getting embittered about life in general. Isolation would probably kill you; you need the exchange of ideas with people who think the way you do. Watch that you do not take on more than you can handle. If you follow this you should always have a feeling for important social and technological developments.

    <Text>With Jupiter in the twelfth house you look for the meaning of life deep within you as opposed to out in the world. You do not judge people by their exterior, but direct your gaze to their inner qualities. Your deep belief and unending faith in God will always protect you and guide you in life like an invisible hand. Sometimes you have wondrous insights which people around you are not able to see. Metaphorically, you carry the whole world within you. Hard hits of fate which knock other people off their bearings serve you as a challenge to expand your horizons and deepen your faith. You look for the meaning in everything that happens to you and therefore will never give up.



Your strengths provide you with healing qualities that can guide people with problems to the right path. You may do your charity work behind the scenes or in institutions. You could have the potential to help a lot of people just by being with them.



If you have not developed far enough and are still fighting your way through life, you should definitely avoid every kind of drug. If Jupiter has difficult aspects in the twelfth house, you could have a tendency to make yourself a martyr, because you do not know another way to break out of your isolation.

    <TextId>Saturn - The Necessity of Responsibility</TextId>
    <Text>The planet Saturn has a diameter of approximately 110,000 kilometers and circles the Sun at a distance of 1426 million kilometers. Its orbit takes an average of 29 years, which causes it to travel slowly through the astrological chart. Mythology reports that Chronos (Saturn) ate his children because he thought their power hunger would drive them to murder him, as he dethroned his father by killing him. 



In Astrology Saturn is considered the karmic planet. Karma is the law of cause and effect. Saturn makes sure that we are confronted with the consequences of our actions. This is especially true of the Return of Saturn, around the age of 29, when the natal Saturn forms a conjunction with the transiting Saturn. This is the time to reflect on life with all its mistakes and regrets, which may force some corrective actions. Saturn is the past, tradition, the father and restrictive principle. Where Saturn is found, there are regularly problems to be solved, as challenges can be found in every horoscope. We have to overcome fear and inhibitions. As seen positively, Saturn brings consistency, perseverance, diligence and responsibility. It rules the sign Capricorn.

    <TextId>Your Saturn in Aries</TextId>
    <Text>Saturn seems to have problems no matter where it is. In Aries, the sign of renewal and unfolding energy for individual goals, Saturn can express itself in one or two ways. 



You may begin an egotistical climb to the top, showing no regard for the feelings and needs of others, whereby you will have difficulty bringing yourself to cooperate with others and be unable to compromise. You press on putting yourself under unbelievable time pressure, which does not accomplish anything anyway, because you get bored fast and lose interest in the results of your work.



The opposite case could also come about, making it hard for you to take the initiative and practice your convictions. Without the support of those around you, you do not dare take even one step and are also anxious about any changes. Risks or any endeavor with an uncertain outcome are to be avoided at all costs. Your exaggerated need to feel secure makes you blind to opportunity letting you see only the dangers of a new development.



Experience will force you to recognize your strengths, use them and teaches you that perseverance and initiative are necessary prerequisites not only for independence, but also for a harmony within a group. Once you have understood this, it will be possible to achieve things you could not have dreamed of before. The combination of self-discipline and creative ideas is the basis for every successful endeavor. You could take on tremendous tasks by setting your determination and persistence towards concrete goals.

    <Text>Quite probably you have an exaggerated need for security and make yourself a slave to your possessions, laboring from dawn until dusk to fill your pension fund and secure your income in your old age. In order to see continued returns on your investments, you avoid risks and incalculable enterprises. Those around you may consider you greedy or stingy. The myriad pleasures of life do not draw your interest. Mineral water quenches thirst just as well as champagne. If you cannot get your way, you get cranky. You may have a tendency to think of others as your property and become overly jealous. Saturn will teach you a couple of lessons in this respect. You are called upon to learn to deal reasonably with various resources and to acknowledge that there can be no absolute security. Maybe you have lost your possessions, have had to start all over and have learned there are not very many things you really need in order to live.  It might also be that people start avoiding you because they do not want to let themselves be encompassed by you. This will eventually bring you to acknowledge the free will of each individual. Personal experience will teach you to enjoy life. By dealing with possessions sensibly, you will lose your fear of the future and be able to work persistently and still enjoy yourself in the evenings. The world of finance may be the best place to look for success.

    <TextId>Your Saturn in Gemini</TextId>
    <Text>Quite possibly, you are excessively working yourself up to sense an unhealthy distrust of everyone. You always look for depth and the sense in something and are not capable of laughing over a simple joke. Social circles where people just play around and enjoy each other do not interest you. This makes it difficult for you to meet people and leaves you feeling frustrated. Problems with neighbors and siblings can prove to be inevitable because you have not mastered the art of light conversation. This may be due to a speech disorder or you may not feel confident enough to say a lot in a group. You think of yourself as uneducated and admire people who have lots of friends and get to know people easily.



No matter which problems arise, your experiences will not be in vain. The lessons of life will discipline your thinking so you can solve the most complicated problems. Logical thinking is one of your strong points, enabling people to trust your judgment. Because your knowledge was acquired through a lot of work, it would make sense for you to put it to sensible use. The natural sciences, teaching or bookkeeping may interest you. Continuing education could give you the confidence you need to relax when approaching people.

    <TextId>Your Saturn in Cancer</TextId>
    <Text>The position of Saturn tells that your childhood was not especially happy and that you had a number of problems with your parents. They may have been very strict and incapable of providing warmth and security. For this reason it is still difficult for you to learn to show your feelings and let people get close to you. You may be repeating the mistakes of your parents and find it difficult to create a loving atmosphere in your family. You tend to hide behind your shell and lose contact to your environment. Maybe you withdraw alone at home because being out in public makes you feel insecure. Or you may be oversensitive and get thrown off by the slightest criticism.



The responsibilities of family life and the organization of family affairs are your responsibilities. Even if it proves to be extremely difficult, you are going to have to learn to open yourself up, at least to those closest to you. This could create barriers to establishing your own family. A family will eventually know your needs and problems intimately and be able to change your behavior and show you genuine affection. Once these barriers are overcome, it will be easy for you to take responsibility for your family and be a source of support for them.

    <Text>Most probably, you have problems presenting yourself, which can be expressed in a number of ways. An overdeveloped desire for prestige could be responsible for your tendency to make a fuss over yourself trying to attract attention. If no one notices you, you are insulted. In addition you want to be in control of everything and tell others what to do. Responsibility for failures is easily shoved onto someone else due to your reluctance to accept your own weaknesses. And probably you find if difficult to follow generally accepted rules, insisting on special treatment for yourself.



Saturn in Leo can bring about inhibitions against showing your real personality. You probably like to disappear in the crowd so that no one even notices that you are there, because you have not yet found any way to express your creativity. You may suffer from inferiority complexes.



Experiences in this area will cause you to spend a lot of time thinking about your role in the community until you have found a suitable place. Eventually your self-confidence will develop to such an extent that no one will be able to take it from you. Your awareness of the value of friends and social acceptance prevents you from risking them through reckless behavior. To avoid any further mistakes in this area, examine your place in society critically. You might also consider business an area where you could be quite successful.

    <Text>You could become a champion of work, suffering martyrdom for others. Possibly, you accept only your own work because you know that you do everything better anyway. Others only draw your constant criticism, which makes for a tense atmosphere on the job. Perfectionism and following the rules too strictly leave no room for improvisation and new ideas. Letting go to enjoy life for a change is not easy for you because if you are not able to help out somehow, you feel useless. After quitting time you continue working to keep your house presentable. Continually overloading both your body and mind will eventually result in an involuntary period of rest in a sickbed.



Knowledge gained from experience will enable you to use what you have learned effectively making you a valued colleague. Once you have managed to overcome the divisions between the body and soul and realize the value of a stable state of health, you can serve as an example to others. You pay attention to your body signals and keep yourself in shape. Anyone in need knows they can count on you because you take great pleasure in helping others.



Professionally, you might want to go into the field of health. Your conscientiousness and precision make you suited for work in scientific research, bookkeeping or in a technical field.

    <Text>The area of human relationships could prove to be difficult for you; although you are actually in search of peace and harmony, you do not feel comfortable approaching strangers and are on edge in group situations. Conflicts in partnerships can end with no one willing to give in. You may have too many expectations of your partner and not realize that you are not always the easiest person to live with. It is also possible that you simply are not prepared to accept responsibility and fulfill your obligations. You may be attracted to people who try to control you and are always telling you what to do.



No matter what kind of experiences you have in this area, they will make a new person out of you. Once you have found out that cooperation among equals can produce valuable results, you will become an example to others. People will value you because they can depend on you and know that you would never make promises you cannot deliver. People also often ask you for advice due to your keen sense of justice, which you are more than happy to give. Maintaining relationships is one of the obligations your pronounced loyalty will not let you neglect. Someday you will have a prestigious position and earn a lot of money. You are aware of your social responsibility and will share this knowledge with others.

    <Text>Stubbornness can drive you into ruin, just to prevent you from following a well-intended piece of advice. You take nothing lightly, looking for depth and meaning in everything, whereby you unfortunately tend to exaggerate and act selfishly. In place of a jovial sense of humor, you prefer irony and sarcasm, which gives the impression that you are embittered and often intimidates others. Perhaps you are a fatalist and unable to believe in anything. You have yet to discover your spiritual power. You demand a lot from others and can toil until you collapse from exhaustion in order to achieve your ambitions. Conflicts over financial matters or inheritance could get the better of you. Sometimes you even resort to dishonest means, which causes some people to stay out of your way.



But it does not have to get that far. If you draw the right consequences from your experience, things will brighten up. You can handle all resources responsibly, whether they belong to you or not. When necessary, you can help someone out financially and get them back on their feet. You have an eye for finances and could find a profession in a bank, in commerce or in tax assessment. Your endurance and self-discipline should carry you to success. With your iron will you should be able to achieve any goal you set for yourself.

This has brought you to preach on occasion doing your best to convince other people of your convictions. You can be very intolerant, especially in religious questions, rejecting those with other beliefs. You take your continuing education in philosophy very seriously, which is a shame because it could be a lot of fun. Getting recognition for your intellectual activity is very important to you, but be careful not to become too conceited.

These are problems arising from Saturn in Sagittarius. Your experiences and the consequences you draw from them will lead you to the positive qualities of this Saturn position. You are capable of deep thoughts and great discoveries that shape your perspective. You like to share your realizations with others and are able to keep away from appearing arrogant.

A career is crucial for your ambitions to gain respect and make a reputation for yourself. You may even walk over bodies on your way to the top and feel contempt for anyone who does not set their goals as high as you do. You can make an embittered, overworked, and humorless impression, such that you are not able to enjoy your victories. If you overemphasize your self-control, no one may be able to find their way into your inner world. You will then find yourself isolated and lacking emotion.



The lessons of Saturn in Capricorn will open the positive side of its position. This could be expressed strongly because Saturn is in the sign it rules. You have a great power of concentration and can do a lot for the society in which you live. Never let your work lose its relation to practice if you want to realize your ambitions. People are generally willing to give you recognition for your efforts and you especially appreciate being able to provide others with a feeling of security. A respect for traditional values, such as responsibility, finds its expression in conservative convictions. You are a tireless worker, who earns every success honestly and would never allow yourself to be used. There is no reason for problems with your boss to arise because you are willing to take orders and remain loyal. It would be better if you learned to express your feelings at least to those closest to you, also try to make life more fun. If Saturn receives harmonious aspects, you should become an honorable and successful person. Use your experience to support people who want to establish a professional existence. You could set things in motion, especially in politics.

Unfortunately, you have a tendency to wallow in self-pity, convinced that the world is an evil place and at fault so that you cannot be as cheerful as others can.

You do not have the courage to introduce changes or to look reality square in the face. It could get so bad as to manifest itself in anxiety and nightmares.



The experience of this Saturn position can be instructive enough to put you on the right track.

A profession in the field of science or mathematics would suit you well. If esoteric fields entice you, then it would be a good idea to take a closer look at Astrology; you will not regret it.



There is something that you should be careful of, namely the danger of taking on a very authoritarian attitude. This may come from an experience or a feeling that causes you to sense a threat to your personal security. There may be severe attitudes lurking within you. Become more aware of your tendency to scare people off with your pessimistic and unrealistic attitudes. If you manage that, nothing will stand in the way of the creative life you have been dreaming of.

For this reason, you should be careful not to act too secretively or you will gradually lose sight of reality.

It is high time for you to develop some common sense, which, of course, is easier said than done. Because you often find yourself in crisis situations, you should use them to develop a more relaxed attitude in dealing with people. This is also true for conflicts at work, which at times can pile up overwhelmingly.

If Saturn is dominant, you will try to prevent change by standing in the way of all reforms and innovative influences in society and politics. If Uranus is stronger, you will oppose the existing circumstances. In either case, you will have to avoid taking on a too rigid position because this could arouse the indignation of others.



Finally, you are called on to find the golden mean, then if you stand in the way of changes, your foundation will not necessarily be safe from destruction. If you instigate drastic reforms, you may have to wait a long time for any signs of success. This is because you simply do not have enough experience to go about putting your ideas into practice. Before you find yourself, you may take on authoritarian characteristics and maybe also seem eccentric. If you do not do something about it, you may find yourself isolated, which you probably want to avoid. Do something for the development of your common sense, which will help you to act appropriately at the right moment.

Your professional activities could get chaotic, even reaching the point where you are ready to run away from your obligations, although even that will not help. Someday you are going to have to find a way to reasonably come to terms with reality. Do your best to make sure that you are honest in setting your goals. Have confidence in your abilities, even if it seems like everything you do is a disaster. That is not so tragic because only by analyzing barriers will you find out how to go about making your life more successful. Once you have achieved that, your self-confidence will be in better shape and you will finally be able to recognize and appreciate your own competence.

Learn to open up to others and talk about your weaknesses; you would not be living on this planet if you were perfect. You may be lacking personal integrity, but there is no reason to withdraw from social challenges, because you have a lot of potential that only requires more confidence. What you need is someone who can give you advice and help to bring out your talents. With a little help, you will be able to take on the challenges and responsibilities, especially if you do not let yourself be driven by a desire to manipulate the lives of others.

    <Text>An understanding of the subtle energy forms, which serve as the basis for life, enables you to make use of them. No matter were you go your vitality is noticed and appreciated. Inner stores of energy always stand ready allowing you to take that one extra step necessary to meet your goal. Working carefully and having prepared thoroughly, you endeavor to bring about fundamental changes in your life and in the lives of others.



Even if it really is not your style, you are in a position to serve as a kind of spiritual guide for your friends, because your sensitivity and intuition enables you to master conflicts and crisis. Possibly you have the curse of constantly lucking out, just do not let yourself depend on it. It would be better if all of life's challenges do not always come to a happy end all by themselves, giving you reason to engage your hidden talents.

    <Text>The way you organize your work is exemplary, because you take the work entrusted to you seriously.

In spite of your serious approach to life, you can loosen up and enjoy yourself without feeling guilty about it. Seeing the fruits of your endeavors gives you great satisfaction. This makes you less dependent on "chance" or the good will of strangers. Probably you have a good relationship to your father. Conflicts with him seldom arise and you often turn to him for advice. This aspect will help you to bring orientation into your life.

In groups you often remain quiet, but you are actually concentrating and will be able to say something fitting at the right moment. Because you have started to make plans for your financial security in your old age early, you will be able to enjoy your retirement in comfort.

    <Text>When it comes to clearing up problems, you work hard at it and offer others support that they can count on. If you should ever get involved in enterprises that call for creative ideas, then you will surely distinguish yourself because hardly any one else has enough self-discipline to be able to joyfully fulfill their obligations. This will also make you popular.



Cooperation with groups and institutions are easy with this aspect, especially because both the planets Uranus and Saturn are associated with the sign Aquarius, which is found in the eleventh house and is therefore favorable to group activities. The ability to express your creative ideas systematically and precisely should enable you to work in science and especially mathematics.

This will prove to be helpful because only through discipline will you be able to give adequate expression to your imagination. Let yourself be inspired and if you are then able to carry your impressions, nothing more will stand in the way of your happiness for the second half of your life. With the support of your own view of the world, you are able to organize your affairs with the necessary forethought.



A highly idealistic basic attitude and value system inspire you to develop responsibility and lead you to have higher expectations of others. Although you do not always have the energy to fulfill your obligations, you are aware of this and support others with practical tips.

If you should get interested in esoteric fields, you will be able to use your energies more intensively. Maybe you will be able to learn on your own, because you are able to understand the extent of life's underlying structures. Also, physical and mathematical theories interest you. Be careful not to set your ambitions according to your egotistical desires, but to include others; this will have a positive effect on your well-being.

    <TextId>Your Saturn in the First House</TextId>
    <Text>There is something keeping you from taking on life and really devoting your spirit to your work. You are inhibited. When a good opportunity arises, you usually hesitate too long. Often you sense specific fears for the future and completely doubt your ability to tackle everything coming your way. You may draw negative experiences to yourself, like a flame attracts moths. Someday you are going to have to recognize the necessity of taking on the challenge. Your present attitude only serves to make life more difficult.



Even if you had a difficult childhood with lots of restrictions, you alone hold the key to your happiness. Do not try to make anyone else responsible for your life. Ask yourself first what the events have to do with you. Your high expectations may actually be a hindrance to your efforts.



Sometimes Saturn expresses itself in the first house by making it hard to accept other people's limitations. You may want to dictate how other people should live their lives. You are always a little stiff and neglect fun because you believe that responsibilities come first.



In any case, you should activate your positive energies and be more optimistic. Every difficulty harbors a potential for further development.

    <Text>You have a strong need for security and are convinced that you can avoid the dangers of this world by piling up material possessions and achieving financial security. This can become compulsive and eventually get in the way of your social contacts, which would provide you with approval and make you feel contented. You may even fear that someone is after your horde of goods. You are constantly wary of losing interest or of collapses in the stock market rates. You do not notice the beauty that life has to offer and do not realize what you are missing. Maybe you compensate for your fear of failure at social contacts with your sense of achievement, your pride at having built something and your independence of people, who you consider unreliable anyway. Do not delude yourself.



Eventually you are going to have to fight financial battles and accept some restrictions. It may well be that you grew up in a poor family and now overemphasize material possessions. Do not let it go so far as to measure the worth of a person by her bank account.



Seen positively you know the value of other people's creations and productions and would never waste resources. You approach the realization of your ambitions with enthusiasm and stamina. Your ambitions are always within reach so that during the course of your life, you will become even more relaxed.

    <Text>With Saturn in the third house, it will not be easy for you to find the right words for the various situations you find yourself in, or to express yourself adequately. Communication is always a challenge that you should take on. Even if you hesitate to approach people and talk to strangers, your positive experiences in this area will be helpful to you.



Be aware that people rely on language as a means of communication. It will not help to reject the intellect and refuse to work on correcting a deficit. You are probably intellectually more developed than you seem to be, simply because your language skills are deficient.



In your childhood, learning probably was not much fun and you did not feel comfortable in school. Problems with siblings and feelings of inadequacy may be what is still keeping you from simply expressing your thoughts. Possibly your parents handicapped your development by denying you freedom to experiment thus robbing you of your drive to discover your environment with a child's natural curiosity. Whatever it may have been, you can transform your weaknesses into strengths. Be tactful and learn verbal expression by reading and being a part of your social environment. Even superficial contacts are important and will enrich your life.

    <Text>With this constellation you have experienced emotional or economic restrictions in your childhood. Your family probably was unable to convey the necessary self-esteem that has left you insecure today. You are looking for stability and do not trust your abilities. Get to work on your self-confidence, if you have not started already.



Probably your parents did not provide you with the warmth every child needs, and based their child-rearing on strictly regimenting behavior. Possibly you got the feeling that you were unwanted and developed a guilt complex for having been born. Now you have a difficult task before you, namely discovering your own worth and accepting yourself. Once you succeed, everyone else will finally know whom they are dealing with.



You may have had major conflicts with your father. He was probably very strict and punished you for little things, leaving you constantly in fear of him and feeling that you are doing everything wrong. If you have the opportunity to clear up these problems with your father, it would be beneficial to you.



Hopefully, you will not repeat the mistakes your parents made and shower your children with the warmth and love you never had. In this way, you could alleviate your difficulties and develop a self-confidence that no one will be able to take away from you.

    <Text>It is not easy for you to present yourself and to express your own creativity. Probably things would be different if you were able to imagine the limitless possibilities within yourself. You do not take advantage of the freedom that every individual on the planet possesses, because you are afraid of doing something wrong. You even manage to make what would normally be a pleasant undertaking competitive. It is no wonder that you seem tense and put yourself under pressure.



Even on the rare occasions when you allow yourself to engage in romance, you approach the matter quite seriously. You may have frightened off potential partners because you started talking about marriage during the first round of flirting. You just cannot lie back and enjoy life. You think that everything you do has to have a concrete purpose. You are insecure about letting others in on your inner self and your fantasies.



You will find the causes of this behavior in your childhood. Maybe your parents expected too much of you and did not allow you to be a child. You did everything to fulfill their expectations and never tried to go your own way and never experimented, because every detail was prescribed and regimented.



You can probably take care of your problems once you have children of your own and manage to give them the freedom you never had. You could then let yourself relive your childhood periodically and make up for some of the experiences you missed the first time around.

    <Text>Work and your daily routine have a special importance to you. Unfortunately, you do not always make it easy on yourself. You put yourself under pressure because your perfectionism demands the highest performance and never gives you a break. You should become conscious of the fact that you will never be able to solve the world's problems and that your exact concept of the way things should be only serves to tie you down. Do not construct your own prison, but do not take everything so seriously.  Learn when it is better to ignore things.



This constellation can be expressed in the other extreme and lead to a rejection of responsibility and a denial of obligations. You fear the restrictions of a steady job and are considered unreliable.



If you run into problems or are dissatisfied with yourself, this will make itself known in the form of a physical illness. You have a tendency to use your body to vent your frustrations in stressful situations, probably because you never willingly take a break.



Take a closer look at the mechanisms at work suppressing your memories to find out what you are actually afraid of. Maybe you are suffering from an unfulfilled romantic passion.

    <Text>You are faced with the challenge of solving problems in personal relationships. You fear contact with other people and think you will be too vulnerable if you open yourself to others.



You may have actually had some bad experiences in your relationships. You usually attract dominant, energetic partners. You become dependent and may even let yourself be tyrannized. You are looking for security and stability in a relationship and sometimes sacrifice your independence for it. Often you are drawn to older partners changing the character to a father-daughter or mother-son relationship as opposed to an equal partnership. Whatever the case, do not complain about your partner, just find out what got you into the relationship and deactivate the mechanism.



Possibly your parents had a troubled marriage and fought a lot. That would explain your hesitation to get into a steady relationship. Maybe you are afraid that a serious relationship will restrict you, either that or you are waiting for your prince or princess.  You probably will not have a satisfying relationship until later in life.

    <Text>With Saturn in the eighth house you fear losing control over your emotions and live withdrawn and isolated. You do not try to give a partner a chance to fulfill your need for love and devotion. You probably have problems with sexuality, which are expressed in prudishness and lack of understanding for the importance of sex.



Sometimes you do not think thoughts through to the end, which you cannot get out of your mind, or you deny recognizing the answer to existential questions. You will not open yourself to the principle of constant giving and taking, which no one can live without, because you fear losing your individuality. Fear is the driving factor in your life. If you do not overcome it, you will become more and more isolated. You should learn to place your resources at the disposal of others, because you can only profit by it. It is not beneath your worth to accept offers from others without asking what is expected in return. If you try to manipulate or dominate people too often, it could have bitter consequences.



In principle, you are concerned with only one topic: detachment. You have to find your natural strengths and accept the flow of life. Even if you find it disturbing, you should confront the concept of death and accept it as the threshold to another existence.



You can be professionally active working with other people's finances, for example, in banking or in the stock market. If you get entangled in conflicts, then avoid going to court; that will only make things worse.

    <Text>When you look into religion, philosophy or higher education, you have a dogmatic approach. This can go so far that performing a specific ceremony may be more important than its actual content. You would make a good fanatical missionary, who wants to spread the faith without considering the consequences or who finds fulfillment in ascetic behavior. Never forget the principle of brotherly love, which in one way or another is a part of every religion.



Your convictions could lead you to push your outdated morality onto yourself and others, because you reject our present social development and its accompanying individualism. You may have never come to know the spiritual freedom that is associated with the ninth house, because your parents had fixed ideas about how their child should go through life. Unfortunately, you have a tendency to see future developments in a negative light and deny yourself opportunities.



Possibly you have developed in the opposite direction and reject belief, moral, ethics and law, because you live by your own rules. It would do you good to clear your head and address the basic questions of existence, whereby the character trait, tolerance, would suit you well.

You are known for your superhuman stamina, but you should watch out or inappropriate self-confidence could become a trap. Take a look at your weaknesses periodically, and do not be too quick to judge others.



You want to be respected and are willing to work to achieve status. Your ambition is to do something that will have a lasting impact, like constructing buildings, or founding an administration. It is not difficult for you to sacrifice because you do not place much importance on fun anyway. You follow a clearly defined goal and will do everything to achieve it. Just do not make the mistake of using others as instruments of your ambitions.



Saturn with negative aspects could point to difficulties on the social level, whereby it may take a long time for you to find your niche in life. You may have to deal with a few failures at work.



Your father influenced your values significantly, even if he did seem to be strict and without feeling. You could still feel that you have to prove something to him by your achievements.



You would like to be an example and have great discipline and powers of concentration. Seldom do you run the risk of losing your grip on reality, which is why you should at least experience satisfaction at work.

You may feel inhibited and feel inferior to others or you fear that too many new experiences could throw you off your bearings. You may be convinced of the need to conform and are in danger of losing your individuality. In any case, you should stay in contact to others. This will guide you to the most important realizations. Only if you continue to participate in the social group and learn to open yourself up will you be able to get rid of your compulsive behavior.



Be aware that good friends would never ask for more than you are allowed to expect from them. You should be more easy-going with your friends. What could possibly happen that could be so terrible?



Once you have found your own way, you could achieve a lot and also serve as an example for reliability and responsible behavior. You will initiate projects that strive for serious reforms and shape the future. You put humanity first. Your concept of reality will help you to achieve your ambitions.

You refuse to look deep within yourself, although you know that it is the best way to overcome your fears. Possibly you have nightmares or a deep-rooted guilt complex. You also have problems with loneliness; you may often withdraw from others or try to avoid being alone with yourself, because you get depressed. You always try to keep control over your feelings, although it is not necessary because you could not express anything but understandable human emotions.



Try to overcome your pessimism; it is only turning you into your own enemy. You should learn trust and try to get a handle on your fear of failure or one day you may find yourself in institutions such as hospitals, prisons, or homes or you may earn your living working there.



Once you have accepted all the sides of your personality and have learned to deal with your fears, you will be capable of deep feelings and of finding fulfillment in helping weaker people. You will not be satisfied with superficialities and have a large store of energy from which you can nourish your consciousness of being part of something greater.

    <TextId>Uranus - The Process of Emancipation</TextId>
    <Text>The planet Uranus was first discovered in March 1781, at a time when in Europe old structures were breaking down and France stood on the verge of revolution. Its diameter is 49.000 kilometers and it takes 84 years to orbit the sun, taking about 7 years to cross through an astrological sign. In Mythology Uranus was Saturn's father, who castrated him and produced many terrible children. 



In Astrology Uranus denotes a break with tradition as well as new development; it is spirit, intuition and spontaneity. Its position in the chart tells us about our relationships with our friends as well as our attitude toward authority. Uranus can also bring about a revolution and can destroy that which it cannot improve. Uranus rules the sign Aquarius.

    <Text>With the planet Uranus in the sign Aries you are at least 60 years old and grew up during World War II. At least in Germany, this generation was forced head out to find new paths.

 

This Uranus position helps you to develop a strong will to gain intellectual independence. Refusing to tolerate any interference whatsoever, you make your own decisions and draw your own conclusions. An autonomous spirit empowers you to explore the truth with no reservations. Outdated ideas and methods are dropped if they cannot be proven true.



If Uranus in Aries is receiving challenging aspects from other planets, they can be vehement. You may be drawn to rather unreal ideologies or may be quick to use aggression. Generally, you say whatever comes to your mind.



To live in contentment, you require a steady stream of new impulses or adventures in which you can prove yourself. People may accuse you of being explosive. When people start referring to you as a choleric, it will be time to put more effort into cooperating with other people and taking their interests into consideration.



It is possible, that you will lose your perspective of societal structures by continually placing your own ego first. This could prove to be detrimental to your plans for changing the world according to your own concepts. A higher development will provide you with the ability to combine spiritual energies and ethical ideals.

    <Text>From the year 1935 until 1942, Uranus was in the sign Taurus. Its generation was born during the turmoil of the war and endeavors to actively prevent that kind of disaster from ever being repeated. One measure they suggest is to redistribute the material resources of the planet according to humanitarian criteria. You show imaginative determination in your endeavors that can make you successful.



Although you are attached to possessions and are constantly collecting things, you have an unorthodox relationship to them. The spontaneous element of the planet Uranus in Taurus can express itself in sudden changes in your financial situation. The problem is that you have an appreciation for life's comforts and need to feel secure, on the other hand you want to protect your independence in order to live according to your principles. If Uranus receives negative aspects, you could glorify progress to the point where you throw traditional values overboard.

You may belong to the forerunners of educational methods and become active in research. Also the world of media interests you, you enjoy the diversity in this area already evident in your life.



You probably have a lot of good ideas, but have difficulties realizing them. You get bored quickly, are distracted by new endeavors and do not have the perseverance to stick with one task long enough to get it done. Uranus was in Gemini from 1942 until 1949, so that no statements should be made without consulting the rest of the chart.



If Uranus in Gemini receives challenging aspects, you can easily overexert yourself in too many different activities. You should choose a few areas instead of being content with rather deficient competence in a lot of different areas.

    <Text>Uranus was in Cancer from 1949 until 1955 so that the rest of the chart should be consulted before any concrete statements can be made. Generally, this planet position stands for moodiness and emotional irresponsibility, also for original communal living. That generation tried to leave home relatively early and realize its own ideals. This caused a generational conflict, and consequently an intensive exchange. New ideas about home and family were developed and exchanged and women reconsidered their role in society. Family structures changed because every individual demanded more freedom for its own growth. Siblings, parents and other relatives were also expected to befriend each other in order to get along. The negative aspects occurred amidst the confusion because useful traditions were thrown overboard as well as pointless constraints.



If Uranus has a challenging aspect, your family life may be prone to sudden changes, which, most certainly, will not always be easy to deal with.

    <Text>The planet Uranus in Leo represents the generation that was born from 1955 to 1962. Its members attempted to loosen concepts of love and sexuality, and may still want to. Sexuality was discussed openly for the first time causing several taboos to bite the dust. Tradition and strict regulations gave way to kindness and individuality. Free love, whatever that may be, could be a synonym for Uranus in Leo. There was a lot of experimentation in this area. However, after the AIDS virus made its way into the public consciousness, there is less clarity about the ideal form of love. You will have to find your own way of dealing with your passions in this age.



You command originality and resolution on every level of expression. When you entered the world, art was revolutionized, which may explain your interest in this area.



In Leo Uranus finds its exile, thus you should keep your egotistical and narcissistic tendencies in check and work creatively towards finding a solution to the urgent global problems rapidly becoming more threatening. Today it is becoming increasingly more important for a larger percentage of the population to understand that we should preserve life on this planet for our children.

    <TextId>Your Uranus in Virgo</TextId>
    <Text>Your generation (from 1962 until 1968) is in a position to revolutionize employment structures and develop a new understanding of service to one's neighbor. On the way to an individual interpretation, the house position of Uranus and the receiving aspects should also be taken into consideration. Generally, it can be said that you may be interested in medical research and working for more rights in the workplace. The equality of the sexes must be emphasized within this context. You will use your humanitarian principles to make progress in union work and to develop new more benevolent technologies. You are good with computers and can no longer imagine your workplace without one.



If Uranus receives negative aspects, you may be prone to sudden physical ailments. It may help to entrust your health to a natural healer because you are skeptical of standard medicine.



Your generation would be especially well suited to work for the ecological regeneration of our planet because the Uranus/Pluto conjunction in Virgo in your chart gives you the imagination to take on global problems. Probably you could create more use for environmentally friendly, naturally grown hemp and develop technical facilities to make it more usable.

    <Text>With the planet Uranus in Libra, you belong to a generation of people who formulated new concepts of relationships and coexistence. You make useful experiences with various partners. A marriage license is no longer important. One belief that is becoming more common is that a man and a woman no longer need a bureaucratic blessing in order to be permitted to love each other. You also accept other forms of sexual preferences because your parents have begun to put taboos to rest.



To get a more individual interpretation of Uranus, consult its house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. Your generation is between 21 and 27 years old today and is interested in alternative living cultures. Some of you live in communes and most have equal relationships.



During this position of Uranus there were great changes in popular music. Computer software has largely replaced orchestras and new styles of music, for example Jamaican reggae, which is oriented on the values of Libra (justice and equality) have come up in this area (Bob Marley is better known today, years after his death than ever before).

    <Text>In your life you will experience many drastic changes which put anything and everything in question. You will experience an unprecedented upheaval when the outdated social systems are cast off. A clearer, more personal interpretation of Uranus can be achieved by consulting its house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. Your generation is between 15 and 20 years old today and probably in favor of less formal forms of communication and interaction.



You will discover abuses and intolerable states of affairs in communal living and be interested in working for the survival of humankind on this planet. The regeneration of raw materials is important; hemp, for example, is one that unfortunately has a reputation for being a dangerous, intoxicating substance. It is no longer being ignored that in Europe, a cultivated plant without THC (the substance responsible for the intoxicating effect) is being planted and can be used for an unbelievable variety of uses. Still, farmers who want to plant it are intimidated both by the bureaucratic barriers and the lack of support from the establishment.



You should try not to let yourselves be led by your feelings and when changes are necessary, do not make such a commotion. Progress is good and important, still things should move harmoniously instead of being played out in extremes. This ensures that everyone can understand what is going on and no one is suddenly blown over.

Sagittarius stands for the search for new spiritual foundations to prepare for a more advanced form of society. This means higher insight into the role of humanity on the Earth and in the Universe. When Uranus was in Saturn (1982-1989) a "green" consciousness was formed for the first time. Since then, green parties have been founded in many countries, which brought many people an alternative to the established political parties.



Uranus in Sagittarius is associated with higher knowledge. This is why a renaissance in esoteric fields can be observed in this time period. Astrology advanced especially quickly, because it is practically applicable.



Finally, it should be mentioned that airplane traffic intensified during this Uranus position (Sagittarius is the sign of long journeys) and the world has gotten smaller. Many people have had experiences with foreign cultures and hope that they left a lasting impression.

    <Text>A personal interpretation of this planet position can be obtained by consulting the house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. The generation of Uranus in Capricorn has either just been born continuing up to 9 years of age, or is between 87 and 93 years.



These very young people will participate in significant modifications in politics and economics that will serve to make people aware of their responsibility to their living environment. They want to bring about changes to secure the basis for life also for the coming generations. Capricorn is, among other things, the sign of national political power. The world wide political upheavals between 1989 and 1995 cannot be ignored, nor the detrimental consequences for the communist systems. Uranus is not only about destroying outdated systems, but also about sensible alternatives. In Russia and other former eastern block countries, the changes came about too fast, accounting for the tendencies which are not only positive. Plutonium and Uranium from Soviet stockpiles seem to be easily available today. Under the guise of political unity, an entire city was flattened.



These people with Uranus in Capricorn will be creative researchers and will hopefully dedicate themselves to developing methods to utilize our planet less destructively.

    <Text>A personal interpretation of this planet position can be obtained by consulting the house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. The generation with Uranus in Aquarius is today, 1999, between 78 and 85 years old.



In the year 1996, Uranus returned to Aquarius, the sign it rules. Many Astrologers recognize this as the beginning of the Age of Aquarius, the age following the one of Pisces. The central figure of the past age was Jesus Christ, whose sensitivity was unique and who, if the common traditions can be believed, practiced a kind of brotherly love that we unfortunately could not live within our societal contexts in the past 2000 years. Uranus in Aquarius will make us abruptly aware that the destruction of our living space has already progressed to an advanced stage, in which nothing short of a global brotherhood and sisterhood will give us hope of saving at least parts of it. The positive side of the development is that more people understand that the unrestrained exploitation of our Mother Earth is making a few people very wealthy while deteriorating the general quality of life.



If Uranus receives negative aspects, you may tend to obstinacy and impracticable ideas while shying away from responsibility.

People with this constellation have the general ability to comprehend the facts both intuitively as well as rationally. At this level, at the time of your birth was the wild 20's, in which the people generally lacked restraint and in the field of music, temperamental styles became popular. People wanted to get away from out-of-date traditions to give individual personality more expression. The connection to the spirit became important again.



If Uranus receives challenging aspects, it may be difficult for you to accept reality and live in the here and now.

    <TextId>Your Uranus in Conjunction with Your Neptune</TextId>
    <Text>This conjunction has been in the sign Capricorn since 1989 and based on an orb of eight degrees, it lasted until 1997. During this time, we observed that one of the dominant political systems simply was not able to live up to expectations and has more or less disappeared from the scene, without being able to cover up the destruction of the environment or human rights abuses they left behind. Although there are many aspects of democracy that should be discussed further, and the last word certainly has not been spoken, still it has been shown that this system is more stable than communism, which was primarily characterized by inhumanity.



Capricorn is the sign of politics and reason. Uranus, which has a tendency to suddenly break into action and Neptune who reveals illusions, have made it hard for politicians to feed the masses empty promises. This has caused political disaffection to take hold, which could become dangerous when moderates stop participating in elections and enable fanatical splinter groups to establish themselves in society.



Generally, a period of elemental spiritual and intellectual progress for all of humanity is due. With this aspect in your horoscope, you should belong to a new group of souls capable of bringing forth humanitarian ideas appropriate to our time and in support of the development of mankind. It will take a couple of years until these people develop their potential.

    <Text>This aspect is found in the charts of people born between 1962 and 1968. Because the Uranus-Pluto conjunction was in Virgo, the discoveries of this time are associated with this sign. There was research into ways of preserving and packaging foods. Since then it has become clear that many of these achievements have done more harm than good. The environment is being exploited more and more and the heritage we leave to our children becomes more and more polluted. 



This aspect in your chart makes you rebellious; you could make the deactivation of social mechanisms that you consider to be outdated your life's work. If you should happen to know what life is all about, you could develop ideas that change living conditions for the better.



Being in a position to understand the fixed rules governing the development of mankind, you are also aware that these rules are necessary to implement needed changes. Be careful that your lack of discipline does not lead you to misuse your influence for the satisfaction of your own egotistical desires.

Sometimes sudden changes transform your life, but you usually tend to adapt to new situation, well because you are extremely flexible.



You are a freedom-loving person and are conscious of your own independence. Still, you need a lot of contact and a large circle of friends in order to feel at home. Be careful that a lack of concentration does not cause you to have accidents.

Because Uranus stands for every kind of new technology, this conjunction may imply an interest in research of the natural sciences.



On the other hand, Uranus is also concerned with freedom, this will make the restrictions at work seem painful. If you have a general tendency to rebel against authorities then you should get started building up your own business, so that you can work independently.

Become more patient and work for compromises even if they come at the cost of your individuality. Listen to the suggestions and the criticism of others or you will find yourself alone some day. It is important for you to learn to carry responsibility and to make long-term plans. If you do not, unforeseen events, such as an accident, could force you to change the course of your life.

During this time, means of communication and transportation were developed and the world became smaller; mankind was impressed by the first films from the Earth's crisis centers. Also, the first commercial non-stop transatlantic jet powered flight was accomplished and the first monkey was launched into space.



Personally, you could be inclined to violent temper tantrums, wild escapades, hectic reactions and have a shaky outlook on life. Although you can be extremely idealistic, it takes on a form that is sometimes difficult for others to follow. This may cause conflicts and chaotic situations which you will be forced to deal with.

At this time there was a great economic crisis and people were busy trying to find some way of getting something to eat. Regular work was hardly imaginable. In Germany, the time was ripe for Adolf Hitler. He brought relative "order" to the existing chaos, but the price for his followers was very high, which none of us are likely to forget very soon, even if we were not alive at the time.



In your individual birth chart, this aspect is made valid by your efforts to change the existing social circumstances. Your motives may contain aspects that have to be taken seriously, because you are an honest person. Still, you may have had to deal with difficult circumstances since the beginning of your life, which may hinder you in your enjoyment of material pleasures. You should not make yourself a martyr.

Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and the Emperor of Japan, Hirohito, were in a position to exercise a hypnotic influence on masses of people, which finally brought about the death of many people and left destructive scars on the world.



On a personal level, you can work against a repetition of history by denying your support to politicians who do not earn your trust. You should look behind the scenes and be able to sense injustice. But that alone is not enough, it is also your responsibility to place what you have learned at everyone's disposal. Possibly you have utopian ideals or want to encourage the spiritual development of mankind.

    <Text>This sextile is found in the charts of people who were born between 1964 and 1968. This conjunction can only be seen in connection with the simultaneous Pluto-Uranus conjunction, whereby Pluto stands at a sextile to Neptune in your chart. Because the Uranus-Pluto conjunction has come about in the sign Virgo, and builds a sextile to Neptune in Scorpio, some discoveries associated with Virgo were made during this time. A process for preserving food was discovered as well as new forms of packaging. It has since become clear that some of these achievements have done more harm than good.



Also, a kind of uprising among the youth emerged during this time; in America, for the first time, people were unwilling to send their sons 7000 miles to a foreign, inhospitable country, to lose life and limb.



With this sextile, you should be able to develop an intellectual consciousness and under certain conditions realize a lifestyle which seemed to be unrealistic. A good example of this is rock music, represented by the legendary open-air festival in Woodstock at the end of the 60's. Although the long-haired musicians, which some found to be noisemakers, were initially sneered at, many of them became millionaires, even if their sometimes fatal way of life did not exactly meet with the approval of the masses.

On an individual level, your intuitive perception could enable you to go into scientific research. You understand the intrinsic structures of the natural powers and wish to change the predominant social circumstances and initiate constructive improvements in your environment. In active pursuit of higher learning you try to deepen your intuitive insights.

Maybe your eccentric behavior brings a little excitement to work or maybe you have even won prizes for your suggestions for improvements. Individuality is one area where you are not willing to compromise, and that is exactly what gives rise to your prestige.



Uranus stands for everything which has to do with technology, this is why this sextile can lead you to the area of research in the natural sciences. Also the relationship to your parents may be very unusual. Possibly, one of your parents was very eccentric and always impressed you, so much so that it had a tremendous impact on your life.

    <TextId>Your Uranus in the First House</TextId>
    <Text>Doing almost everything differently than everyone else has become your trademark. You always seem to be on the go and are constantly thinking up crazy new ideas. How many of them are put into practice is another question; which does not have anything to do with Uranus in the first house. Being very unconventional and always conspicuous, traditional ties like marriage and family do not especially attract you. It would be best if you were allowed to find your own way and not have to suppress your individuality. The technical fields are where your greatest talents lie. Because Uranus is associated with electricity, you will also be able to repair an iron. Sometimes you are not able to see lurking dangers. Some people can be hurt due to your fear of responsibility. Despite this, you have high ideals and run onto the battlefield with flags flying under the motto, "freedom, equality and brotherhood". Your ideas concerning cohabitation should be decidedly modern and you have mostly good intentions. If you manage to give in to some situations without providing commentary, you should have no social problems.

    <TextId>Your Uranus in the Second House</TextId>
    <Text>You have a special capacity to adapt to new situations quickly and know how to get by in difficult times. You make creative use of your material resources and are often lucky. Possibly your financial situation is constantly changing. Some day you may be forced to start all over again from scratch, but you will manage it somehow. You love speculation and are not averse to the game, which is why you should consider carefully how far you want to go in this respect.



You can sense financial developments and come up with original strategies to use your knowledge to your advantage. In the second house, Uranus is not dependent on its possessions but appreciates the possibilities for experimentation, which are certain to open.

    <Text>You are original and have your own way of thinking. As is to be expected, this tends to cause misunderstandings, especially with people who do not have a feeling for creative language and who tend to express themselves conventionally. You, however, love to create your own words and think up imaginative formulations. Probably you would be a good journalist and be very successful in media.



You perceive the world with your own eyes and do not want to let anyone dictate how you should see things. You approach new areas naively and are able to discover aspects that are overlooked by people with fixed conceptions. Your curiosity is as large as your love of freedom. Quickly and intuitively, your sharp powers of reason find the answer to important questions. The only thing missing is stamina.



You should try to get your nerves under control. If problems with your brothers and sisters should come up, you patiently look for an answer and listen attentively to what is said to you.

    <TextId>Your Uranus in the Fourth House</TextId>
    <Text>Probably the search for your roots or for a real home has worn you out for a long time. Stability was not something your family could offer; you may have had to move often as a child. Your outlook on life was formed independently of the values of your family. Even if your first actual flight out of the nest was not your idea, you still wanted to be independent from early on. Because you were different, you did not feel accepted and have had to pay for this with a restless nature. It is to be hoped that you will one day find a place where you can settle down with people you love. Hopefully, you will not make the mistake of letting your fear of attachments cause you to pack up and move on suddenly, continuing your search.



Maybe your mother was not able to offer you the security you needed as a child and was often not there. That explains why you do not even want to be available for your own family and frequently present with decisions that you made without consulting them.

    <Text>You have an original way of expressing yourself and you put all your determination into it. With your creative ability you astound everyone because you are ahead of your time and make use of your unusual way of expressing yourself. Do not let anyone convince you to take on a more conventional style, continue your pioneering efforts because this is your talent.



You have an unusual love life, you are not the type for long relationships because you get bored quickly and valiantly defend your precious freedom. You are easily impressed by new acquaintances. Ask yourself if the warmth and familiarity that comes from living according to your whims is enough for you.



If you have kids, although you will avoid this responsibility for a long time, you should be able to build up a good relationship with them. You will raise your kids progressively and give them a lot of your liberal attitudes on the way.

    <Text>You put a lot of thought into your work and want to be constantly challenged. Humanitarian ideals are what you enjoy working towards the most, although you do not like to work on one thing very long. You do not work out of a pure sense of responsibility to your employer, but really want to commit yourself. Once you have taken on something, you will make a lot of suggestions that will bring about a lot of improvements. Use your flexible intellect to come up with ideas to help people. When inspired to be active, you could serve as an example for finding fulfillment in your profession.



If the aspects to Uranus are difficult, you could quit your job often because your expectations are too idealistic. Possibly your colleagues complain about your flightiness and have difficulties with your eccentric nature. Maybe you overload yourself until your health suffers. The sixth house stands for our relation to our body. You should be sensitive to your body's signals and take its needs seriously.



You are interested in all the new technological developments and should be adept at working in research because you devote yourself to tasks without preconceived notions.

    <Text>You are looking for an unusual relationship, which will inspire you and shoud not restrict you. Honesty and creativity are the most important factors. Boredom is not easy for you to stand. This may result in a string of short-lived romances. You may suddenly meet someone who transforms your consciousness from one day to the next and insists on marrying, only to get divorced after six months.



Your role in society will go beyond the traditional social circles. You will always be full of surprises, have an unconventional way with people and probably have a talent for diplomacy, even if people sometimes find you taxing.



Possibly you will find yourself in a dilemma, if other factors of your horoscope point to a need for security and closeness. Then you should look for a partner who will not restrict your development and can still get involved with you. Activities outside your relationship will always be important to you.

    <Text>Probably challenging situations will awaken a sudden burst of new energy, which will surprise even you. Often you have sudden realizations that help you out of a traumatic emotional state. You take on new projects spontaneously and enthusiastically and are always trying to overcome your limitations. You have a bold approach to work, especially if it is for peaceful coexistence. You could have an extreme sex life because you are insatiably curious about sex and do not want to miss out on a single experience. In bed you love to experiment and probably have a pretty good idea about how an ideal relationship should be.



With all your strength you try to control your emotions, especially anger, hate and jealousy. It is the psychological aspects of Astrology and similar fields which interest you the most. Medicine also arouses your curiosity. Not only your life but also your convictions may be transformed by unanticipated turns that could even result in situations where large sums of money play a role.

    <Text>You have unusual ideas about religion and justice and their role in the formation of communities. You construct your outlook on life, which can change suddenly if you find a more complete theoretical approach. You are constantly hunting for new intellectual insights and endeavor to convince people to think more progressively. Orthodox belief systems and strict moral codes provoke you in such a manner that you never miss an opportunity to take a stand against them. Furthering intellectual freedom for all of humanity is your goal.



In your opinion, even the system of education should be reformed such that humanitarian ideals could be taught to everyone at an early age. The technology and diverse electronic media interest you, as do new means of transportation. That the world is continually getting smaller is a welcome development from your perspective. This brings increased possibilities to move on to a new location.



Possibly you are a fan of science fiction novels. Active participation in the structuring of future civilization would interest you, whereby you would prefer to play an intellectual role.

    <Text>If anyone gave you a chance, you would revolutionize society. You have very progressive ideas about nations and politics that can be called radical. If developments do not continue to progress and the same conservative powers retain control, you are dissatisfied. Professionally, you stand for high ideals and look for a position that allows you to work toward these goals. Possibly you change jobs frequently because you believe that you still have not found the right place and are wasting your energies. Perhaps you have to become a little more patient in this respect and accept the fact that you are not going to be made the Secretary General of the United Nations in the foreseeable future.



In any case, you are well-suited for occupations which are not intellectually restricting and where you can experiment to your heart's content. It is very probable that you have a highly unusual profession or that you work in modern technology. Most probably, the influence of your father on your way of thinking was strong. He was certainly an eccentric and possibly he brought restlessness into your childhood.

    <Text>In the eleventh house Uranus is at home, which intensifies its qualities. You represent high ideals in friendships that are not always very realistic. Your energy is set on finding people with similar convictions to band together for activities. Chances are that you stand for humanitarian and progressive ideas spirited by a powerful will to reform. For others, you could serve as a source of inspiration, when it comes to structuring a peaceful co-existence of everyone on the planet. You feel tied to all of humanity and will never give up hope, probably because you know how much people can achieve once they are united, if the will and conviction are there.



If Uranus' aspects are difficult, it could be that you find yourself in a dilemma: you want to contribute your energy to serving a greater cause within an organization, but at the same time, you are afraid of sacrificing your identity and getting lost in the crowd. It may cause difficulties that you insist on realizing your own ideas and are not willing to listen to others.



However, it should be possible for you to find a constructive solution to these problems in order to get your ideals out to more people.

    <Text>It is certainly not always easy for you to understand your motivations, especially since they can change suddenly. Sometimes a vague foreboding descends upon you, which turns out to be true. Also, sudden transformations in your life may be on the agenda.



Take a trip through your subconsciousness and learn from your complete subliminal experiences in order to acquire the ability to recognize the necessary structures for reforms of this foundation. Your spiritual life is diverse and your most beautiful talent could be helping others out by offering unconventional ideas and intuitive understanding.



If the aspects to Uranus are difficult, there is a danger of your thoughts and feelings getting off track and becoming inconsistent. It is most certainly possible that you could develop insecurities and phobias because you fear complexities but do not want to risk becoming isolated. If you want to solve this problem, you are going to have to dig deep.



Your inclination to spiritual ideas and religious thought can lead you to sects or occult groups. You may even succeed in giving new meaning to the terms mercy and brotherly love.

    <TextId>Neptune - The Cosmic Consciousness</TextId>
    <Text>An astronomer in Berlin who noticed that Uranus often deviated from its orbit first discovered Neptune in the year 1946. The cause had to be an unknown planet, which was then called Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun every 165 years and has a diameter of 47,000 kilometers. It is invisible to the naked eye.



In Mythology, Neptune or Poseidon is the god of the sea and lord of the water, which is the element that forms the basis of all life. The depth of the sea often distorts vision creating the illusion of a surrealistic world. In Astrology Neptune represents deception, mysticism, imagination, dreams, extrasensory capabilities, a foreboding and inspiration. It symbolizes creative energy. With Neptune's help creative abilities can find expression. Neptune stays in one sign for 14 years, therefore its individual interpretation, house position and aspects of other planets should be considered. Neptune is assigned to the sign Pisces.

    <TextId>Your Neptune in Leo</TextId>
    <Text>In order to interpret this planet position for yourself you should consult its house position as well as its aspects to other planets. Neptune was in the sign Leo from 1915 until 1929, so that its generation today, 1999, is between 69 and 84 years old. They actively experienced the Second World War and have most probably made some grievous experiences with abusive human existence on the brink of ruin.



This constellation stands for creativity and imagination, but also for exaggerated stubbornness, self-deception and conceit. This caused the careless speculation and risky investments leading to the stock market crash and the resulting economic crises. Many people paid a high price for arrogantly overestimating themselves. In Germany, the Weimar Republic was founded without a realistic understanding of its actual role.

Its generation today, 1999, is between 56 and 70 years old. You survived the Second World War and probably have endured some rather extreme experiences.



You had a hard time expressing your creativity and imagination in an artistic manner. After the war, it was necessary to concentrate on fundamental needs. This could have left you with a tendency to defy material possessions and with a weakness for garish cuteness. You probably think practically and set your ambitions towards gradually but steadily improving your standard of living. Hopefully, you are not deceiving yourself in this respect and remember the importance of carefully considering what it is you are spending so much time working for.

As part of the generation following the world war, you experienced much confusion in human relationships, especially in romantic relationships. Women started fighting for their rights, demanding equality, which initially caused some turbulence but eventually led to a more positive self-image. It was a time of insecurity, because no one knew exactly how to behave in a family or partnership. This generation had a different concept of peace and harmony, which placed a vast gap between them and their parents. Woodstock brought lots of people together with Neptune in Libra. "Peace, Love and Music" was the message for one hundred thousand young people who came together in the pouring rain, in an unprecedented manner.

At the time of your birth, the society fundamentally changed its attitude toward sexuality. The exploitation of eroticism and sex in advertising as well as in other economic contexts was initiated. A monogamously lifestyle was no longer taken for granted. Electrically produced music has found its niche; many of its artists are getting their views across to their masses of fans. Often they have thought up new visions of peaceful coexistence, which people who have not yet developed to this stage unfortunately are not capable of understanding. Members of this generation will have recognized that our planet has got to be regenerated ecologically and socially and that one day we have got to find suitable measures to restore the balance of our living space.

At the time of your birth, the tourism industry began to boom. Long trips were within almost everyone's reach and the world was rapidly getting smaller. Contact to people in foreign lands was made possible, even though many people today still do not take advantage of the opportunity to broaden their horizons. Far Eastern philosophy made its entry into people's minds and enjoyed more popularity. At the same time, dubious cults or sects came into existence that held their victims captive.



Your generation will increasingly integrate fields like Astrology into their lives. You have understood that it provides a context for people to envision themselves within larger relationships. It is possible that this will lead to an increased respect for our environment.

Neptune has been in the sign Capricorn since 1984 and is planning to stay there until the year 2000. This generation is today, 1999, at the most 16 years old.



Since 1984, the many changes in the area of politics have been causing confusion. The conjunction Neptune entered with Uranus must be mentioned in this connotation because it produces the element of spontaneity. To the world's amazement, the communist system was practically dissolved overnight, as the people recognized that the functionaries had been deceiving them.



Once this state of consciousness has been attained, taking the next step to ecological responsibility is inevitable. Obviously, the inclusion of concrete measures, certain to aid the healing process of our environment must follow, since Capricorn is the sign of social responsibility. Because nationalism inhibits progress, international organizations such as the UN, are gaining in importance. The dawning of the Age of Aquarius must be prepared now.

A fulfilled spiritual life does not let you take life lightly. Your dedication to people in need of your help is rewarded with much love. Your dreams are very important to you, because they tell you if your life is in accord with your soul. Explore your musical talents and try to learn an instrument; that could mean a lot to you. If you can overcome your vulnerability and approach life confidently, you will achieve everything that your imagination will allow you to dream up.

This may cause you to doubt yourself, although the circumstances that you perceive do not have anything to do with you.



On the other hand, you may have a magical attraction that draws other people, which can go so far as to have a hypnotic effect. Still, you are careful not to misuse your influence for egotistical purposes. That could have fatal consequences. Probably you know that the Earth can be peaceful and a healthy place to live and you should use your energies to bring about this transformation, even if your perception of reality is sometimes clouded.

Probably you are most at home in the arts, if you should be able to get your own business going you will be completely satisfied. Esoteric fields could arouse your curiosity and with your sense of perception, you should definitely give in to the impulse. However, you betray a certain instability, and should therefore be careful of excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs.

A deep lack of security and confused emotions prevent you from looking reality in the eye and from letting go of the past. Maybe you set extremely high ideals and beneath a certain level are not willing to leave your dream world and become concrete.



Even if you struggle against it, you are going to have to take on responsibility and realize that no one but you can fill your life with purpose.

It could do you good to learn to say no once in a while. Avoid escaping into your own little dream world, this will only veil your perception of reality.



Although you have a very active imagination and often wish that you had made use of the opportunity to voice your thoughts, you have been holding yourself back all your life. For this reason, you should think about going into a field concerned with the needs of many people, because you are especially receptive to unjust social circumstances. This will also earn you the recognition of others.

Neptune stands for the negative aspects of illusion and self-delusion, while the MC represents social standing. This aspect indicates that this area may be characterized by confusion. You should make an effort to see things realistically, whereby it would be good if you kept one honest person around who you can count on.

    <Text>This aspect can express itself in a variety of ways. Possibly you are afraid of looking inside yourself and discovering something new. You avoid emotions and dreams and do not want to be reminded of the fact that there are dimensions other than the material world, which is your favorite escape. You make little use of your imagination because you want to stay on the ground. If you do not change your attitude about your inner workings and if you remain closed to the spiritual world, you will be forced to recognize one day how empty and boring your life has become.



Maybe you live at the other extreme and never want to take off your rose-colored glasses. You do not feel ready for reality and are afraid to take the crucial steps that would change your life. In this case you will have to analyze your conduct meticulously and come into contact with the outside world. Without a confrontation there will be no further development for you.

You have a tendency to withdraw into a dream world. As a child your parents may have criticized you for this and used the opportunity to express their general dissatisfaction with you.



This has encouraged you to feel comfortable with holding yourself back, although you actually have a very active imagination and often feel that you could have said more. Maybe you should go into a profession concerned with the needs of many people; you are especially receptive to concepts concerning social injustice. This will enable you to earn the recognition of others.

    <Text>This is a beautiful aspect, which will give you the sensitivity to build deep relationships. By staying in contact with your soul and your dreams, you manage life on a daily basis. Your interest for music, poetry and mysticism brings you to think critically about your life but especially about your role in it. A need for harmonious surroundings will prevent you from striving to fulfill your needs at the cost of others. A sense of romance and the tender side of life provide wonderful hours of enjoyment; once you have gained trust you have no problem opening yourself and surrendering to it. The ability to master the tight rope act between taking in and warding off should make you successful.

    <TextId>Your Neptune in Trine with Your Ascendant</TextId>
    <Text>With your sensibility you probably have supernatural abilities which you may not be aware of. Being in a position to look behind the scenes, you are unsettled by what you see there. However, you will not blame yourself but do your best to transform the situation positively.



On the other hand, you may have a magical attraction that draws other people and might go so far as to have a hypnotic effect on people. Probably the danger of abuse of these powers for your own egotistical purposes is relatively small. Probably you know that the Earth can be peaceful and a healthy place to live and you should use your energies to bring about this transformation. This could be emotionally beneficial and earn you the acknowledgment that you have always hoped for.

The atmosphere at home grows out of sensitivity and your relationships with everyone are characterized by warmth.

    <TextId>Your Neptune in Sextile with Your Pluto</TextId>
    <Text>This aspect has been around since about 1943 and will live a long time yet, especially in the current era where Pluto has gotten into an irregular orbit. Therefore, this aspect should be interpreted according to its consequences for the entire world, as opposed to its influence on individuals. With this aspect, mankind should be enabled to achieve spiritual progress, which may reach its climax in due course since Neptune resides in Aquarius. At the end of the eighties, one of the two dominating political systems practically disappeared. The charts of the generations that caused this contained a sextile between Neptune and Pluto.



It was not by chance that this aspect came into being during a critical period of mankind's development. Some people would have us believe that the atomic age would introduce mankind into an ideal world of prosperity and contentment. What was not mentioned was that the potential for destroying the planet Earth several times over was hidden within it. Twenty years ago, people were saying that unbelievable plutonic powers, which were developed by misguided, ingenious scientists, could be used creatively without causing any danger. Today, everyone who is earning a living in the atomic energy industry has no doubt about the potential for disaster which human and technological failures can cause. A look at useful regenerating sources of energy such as hemp, sadly the production of which has encountered strong resistance, reveals that it is high time to place the decisions concerning the well-being of this planet in the hands of people whose vision extends beyond the next election.



Maybe it is time for younger people to take the fate of the planet in their own hands, because they have a future ahead of them and approach planning and structuring with more sensitivity than our older, elected representatives are capable of.



Today, it is more important than ever to let the universal love, represented by Neptune, come to its full expression. This reality and its tragic necessity became a little more clear during the world climatic conferences which took place in Berlin and Rio, where certain island states expressed concern about the rising sea level and who are given no opportunity to do anything about it. Also when we look at the ozone paradox - too much above, too little below - we get an impression of mankind's challenge for the future. A lot depends on how intensively we understand that our normal life span of 70-75 years is nothing in comparison to the time span of the development of the world. Hopefully, one day we will be able to internalize the fact that man is only one small gear in the mechanism of the universe, even if he can think; a fact that may be a tragic element.

Your interests for music, poetry and mysticism bring you to think critically about your life but especially about your role in it. A need for harmonious surroundings will prevent you from striving to fulfill your needs at the cost of others.

Because you can be very charming, you are in a position to capture people's fascination and convince them that what you are working on is worthwhile. If your goals are not egotistical, this could have a positive effect. If you tend to be self-centered, this could have consequences that will be unpleasant for you.



On the other hand, you may have a magical attraction that draws other people, which can go so far as to have a hypnotic effect. Also, here it is vital that it is used for the benefit of everyone. If you are able to learn to be more decisive, your self-confidence will grow and you will be able to devote yourself to higher ambitions.

    <TextId>Your Neptune in the First House</TextId>
    <Text>With Neptune in the first house you do not exactly have an easy time bringing two seemingly contradictory principles into harmony. The emphasis of the first house is the development of individuality, to become an independent personality with individual needs, whereas Neptune stands for the dissolution of the structures of the ego and striving to become part of a greater, all-encompassing self.



If you still have not found the way to transform this conflict into positive energy, you could run the risk of deceiving yourself with convenient illusions. It will be difficult to develop your identity; your lack of self-awareness brings you to constantly reflect on what others are thinking and feeling. In search of perspective and orientation, you run the risk of being used. Eventually, you may turn to drug abuse and sink into the depths of self-pity.



On the other side, your great sensitivity could be of use in your endeavors to express your internal processes artistically. Others may be inspired by you to learn how sincerity and true sympathy can make a difference. Maybe you have prophetic abilities and access to dimensions which remain out of reach to others. The ability to sense what is bothering others is due largely to your healing powers.

    <Text>Reaching a comfortable relationship with material possessions will be extremely difficult for you. In financial transactions you may proceed naively, because you cannot fathom money's importance for some people. Maybe you frequently miscalculate, or unanticipated events absorb your financial security. Compulsive spending or the belief that other people are responsible for taking care of you and helping you stay on your feet, is typical of you.



In any case, you must make an effort to develop a realistic attitude about money and do not put off the issue. Your insecurity may be stilled by material values; however, you must make yourself aware that your spiritual attributes are much more reliable. Do not believe that a well-endowed bank account can protect you from the evils of the world.



If you learned your lesson, you will allow others to share in your material resources or will use them for creative activities.

    <Text>Use your intellect and reason for greater goals. The challenge for you is to integrate your limitless imagination into your thought processes and still come up with clear, logical conclusions. If you manage to avoid getting caught up in clouded thought patterns, you will develop an intuitive understanding for latent changes in your environment.



Expressing yourself by means of conventional information transfer has proven itself to be problematic for you. Artistic expression better lends itself to your impressions and inner turmoil, as you find the apparatus of language too restrictive. Maybe you have already had enough problems stemming from disturbances in communication. Accept the fact that language is the number one means of communication and you have no other choice but to work on alleviating any deficits you may have in this area.



Poetry should make you capable of beautiful expression, because it allows you to describe your dreams and fantasies without being restrained by closed structures. Possibly psychotherapy would be a good profession for you, or work with learning disabled children because you intuitively grasp the meaning of a word and are sensitive enough to understand body language.

The feeling of security you experienced in the bosom of your family will always be a part of you, even if the circumstances were not as ideal as your memories. Do not hold fast to the values you were taught but place them in question. Let go of your romantic attachment to family traditions and its unity and solidarity. Only then will you have a chance to experience these ideals.



There may have been a lot of misunderstandings between you and your mother, which left you feeling confused and disappointed. She could have represented the qualities of Neptune by living removed from the world, maybe she used drugs too much, or maybe she shut out the world to devote herself completely to caring for you.



As a woman, you could run the risk of smothering your children with affection causing them to develop guilt complexes. It is important to maintain distance, a sober outlook and to be able to differentiate between people. Sometimes you take care of people you would be better off avoiding.

Unfortunately, either you are oblivious to your talents or circumstances prevent you from creating. Possibly self-expression is sacrificed to a deep-rooted guilt complex or you simply do not have enough confidence in yourself to experiment. Regardless of the cause, it would do you good to experiment in this area. It is not necessary to risk your steady income to find out how much joy artistic expression can bring.



You are a romantic lover like no other. Love has to be about romance and pain or you do not see any point in it. Watch out that you do not spend too much time in the clouds or your fall could be a hard one. First consider carefully what you really expect from a partner and do not chase after ill-conceived ideals. 



The relationship between you and your children could be similar. Maybe you will not recognize the true personality of your children until after the passing of many years, and than wonder how you could have been so blind. On the other hand, you will support the sensitive and creative side of your children.

    <Text>The challenge of getting your day organized and all your obligations fulfilled satisfactorily often makes you doubt your abilities. Possibly you feel overwhelmed by obligations of keeping your household in order, the demands of professional success and taking your mother to the dentist between all this. It may also be the case, that you reject all responsibility and are oblivious to the fact that your constant daydreaming and irresponsibility are a burden to others. Somehow you do not feel adequately prepared for the cruel world outside and actually do react very sensitively and have even been known to have "allergic" reactions to unpleasant experiences. You should take care to interpret your body's reactions realistically. Ignoring its signals could cause you to lose touch; if you are unable to solve your problems it could affect your health, for example in the form of eating disorders.



On the other hand, you have healing powers and sensitivity for solving problems at work. Once you have gotten your feet firmly on the Earth, which may be unpleasant at times, you go about your work with inspiration and attain deep satisfaction through serving others.

    <Text>It never ceases to amaze you that your partner can still manage to disappoint you although in the beginning everything was so beautiful. Your problem is that your image of your partner was never realistic and you do not see your role in the relationship clearly. This can have various consequences. Perhaps you are looking for bliss and salvation in the relationship and believe yourself incapable of surviving on your own. This is a dangerous attitude and can lead to submissive behavior and tolerance of abuse in relationships. On the other hand, an unattainable romantic ideal could make you wait for the perfect partner, secretly believing that a relationship has nothing to do with day-to-day life. Maybe you are attracted to people with drug problems or to criminals and are determined to help them. You will feel like a martyr and will be disappointed if you do not get the recognition you feel you deserve. Take time to analyze your motivation, which repeatedly guides you to the same experiences.



In spite of all these problems, you are still capable of unlimited, sincere and selfless love. You can truly melt together with the one you love and draw all of your life energy and courage from a relationship. If you keep your eyes open and do not evade problems and conflicts, the relationship will allow you to give a lot and receive even more in return.

    <Text>Death should not instill you with fear, but fascinate you and arouse your curiosity about what is to follow. Also what the French call the "small death" attracts you hypnotically: Through physical union with another person you try to transgress limitations and attain a deeper understanding of human nature.



Wherever Neptune is found, dangers are lurking. Neptune clouds reality and often makes us victims of our own deceptions. For this reason, avoid using sex as a means of escape or believe that it can alleviate spiritual wounds for very long. You will always be an individual as long as you lead a human existence. Intoxication will help you overcome the barrier represented by your body in a relation to another person. You are capable of tremendous sacrifice, but guard against giving up control and meeting your demise in your passion.



If Neptune has difficult aspects, it could be that you change partners often, maybe because you subconsciously want to unite with all of humanity. Also, you could use people and live at their cost. Be assured that what you are looking for in other people has been within you all along.

    <Text>Becoming a part of a higher order and recognizing an all-encompassing truth with the help of your intuition is your greatest desire. Completely opening yourself to a religion, a philosophy or system of values is what you really aim for. However, Neptune will often guide you in the wrong direction. Whether you are seduced by false prophets or believe that only you have the spiritual greatness and maturity to differentiate truth from falsehood: you court the danger of losing yourself in self-deception and mysterious thoughts. Do not be too easily impressed by whatever gurus happen to be around, consider that a beautiful aura can be deceiving and that salvation can be found nowhere but within yourself.



If you do not turn yourself into a martyr leading spiritual crusades, you will actually have the potential to develop your spirit to the station where you can recognize interdependencies and let yourself be guided by the feeling that everything in life has a purpose. You are capable of extraordinary faith and can serve others as spiritual guide. Maybe you will find the source of your inspiration in a foreign country or in a place that appears to you in a dream.

You are a little unsure of your place in society and you often perceive your role incorrectly. This may be why you feel uneasy at your job, and do not realize that you are in need of a completely different kind of challenge. Creative work, where imagination plays a large role and where you are granted a lot of freedom, would be perfect for you.



Perhaps you have strange ideas about your future prospects and are dissatisfied because everything seems trivial when you are looking for something special. On the other hand, you could attain a high position once you have found fulfillment. You have a capacity to make a good impression at public appearances. You may be capable of mesmerizing masses and being successful in politics. Neptune may be able to confuse, but cannot sharpen instinct so let your intuition guide you up the corporate ladder.



The tenth house is associated with the father; he probably had the qualities that Neptune represents to you. Seen negatively, he may have been somewhat irresponsible, seldom available, prone to escaping reality and may have had a drug problem. He may have also lived on the positive side of Neptune and was very loving, sensitive and artistically talented.

With your sensitivity you pick up on vibrations people are sending and often instinctively do the right thing. You were born to connect to every living being in the world and feel encompassing love. Brotherly love is not an empty expression for you; you feel the meaning of this concept and want to live it. Maybe you are actively helping the poor and are involved in charity work. Because you are helpful, you can count on the support of your friends.



Still, you have trouble judging your goals. Motivation is not the problem, but it may well be that you have set goals that no one can reach. You also have to choose your friends and group activities carefully to avoid being used and one day awaking from a bad dream. Especially religious or spiritual contacts will attract you. It is also important to be careful in this area. Although you can find fulfillment in a group, you should never give up responsibility and let yourself become a mindless tool.

    <Text>In the twelfth house, Neptune is in its natural habitat, which will intensify the expression of its qualities. In extreme cases, you may long to return to the womb, where it was warm and you could dream away in a sea of sensations. The material world is more difficult for you to grasp than your world of feelings, sacrifice, dreams and inspiration.



Maybe you are afraid of reality and believe that you could not survive there, preferring to withdraw and escape into illusions. Dimensions could open up to you that are unattainable to others. Beware of taking too many drugs along on trips through your subconscious, you may lose sight of your limits and become trapped in vicious circles.



You are over sensitive and open for mystical experiences, which can drive you to self-annihilation. It is important for you to never give up control over your emotions or the resulting action because you suffer from depression and cannot always differentiate harmful conduct from what is good for you. If you make an effort to understand the external world and try to find a way out of the isolation that is sometimes necessary, you will delight others with your inspiration and be able to draw from a large reservoir of spiritual experiences.

    <Text>With 2400 kilometers of diameter Pluto is the smallest known planet. It was discovered on the 18th of February 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. Pluto requires 247 years and 7 months to circle the Sun. It remains in each sign about 20 years. A moon, Charon, which according to Greek mythology brought the souls of the dead across the river to Hades the antique underworld, circles it. Pluto is the Roman god of the underworld that everyone will meet someday. In Astrology it symbolizes the masses and stands for sudden change, destruction, regeneration and transformation. It can be interpreted in context with the actual happenings in the world. In personal horoscopes one should concentrate on the position of its houses and its aspects. Together, Pluto and Mars rule the sign Scorpio.

Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. A global perspective reveals the cause of the wars experienced by the world as excessive nationalism. Each country wanted to expand its borders and claim more living space. The resulting battles then led to the mass extermination of entire peoples. Also, families represented by the sign Cancer were subjected to transformations and the resulting consequences of dislocation. Agricultural economies were modernized: major changes were introduced by the discovery of fertilizer and insecticides. Research into hydroelectricity manifested itself in dam construction. In Israel, irrigation systems were gradually being introduced making the desert arable, a process which has since been perfected.

Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. The nuclear bomb demonstrated its devastating effects while Pluto was in the sign Leo. Atomic energy has been associated with the planet Pluto ever since, which stands for total destruction. The attributes represented by Leo, haughtiness and arrogance, can cause wars capable of destroying large portions of the world and millions of people. Recently developed weapons have introduced the world to violent dread, although simultaneously, progressive technologies dedicated to the well being of humanity are also being researched. Political systems evolved and then out of pride broke off dialog with each erecting an iron curtain between them. Colonial states achieved their independence assuming the entire responsibility of their newly won freedom.

Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. While it was in Virgo the labor situation and the field of medicine were drastically altered. The role of unions grew in importance because people recognized that they were stronger when they banded together (Pluto is the planet of the masses). The computer was developed and subsequently revolutionized industrial production. Today, a noncomputerized workplace is unthinkable. Food was treated with chemicals. Drugs produced in laboratories changed (or in many cases destroyed) human existence. Of relevance to the policies of population control is the development of the contraceptive pill in this era.

Pluto was first discovered in 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. During its stay in Libra, the sign of harmony and justice, people started seriously reconsidering their ideas about human relationships. People discovered that consensus is more effective than armed conflict. To avoid destroying all life on the planet, made possible by atomic weapons, new ways of reaching agreements have to be developed. Hopefully, the consciousness developed during this era will prove to meet the demands of the future. The world needs standards that can be accepted by everyone, human rights for example, which in many cases were formulated for the first time during this era. Strangely enough, a third world war could be prevented with the aid of weapons of mass destruction. The principle of deterrence has in turn left us with atomic waste that has proven very difficult to get rid of. Political groups, which are working to reestablish the ecological balance of our Earth, have drawn enough attention to themselves to establish themselves in our political landscape. Many people have recognized that the only way our civilization is going to survive is if we manage to increase our willingness to compromise.

    <Text>Pluto should be interpreted for individuals by its house position and its aspects to the other planets because it moves very slowly. The global interpretation of Pluto is more important because it conveys deeper insights. Pluto has been in the sign Scorpio since 1983. In the year 1996, it will definitively progress to Sagittarius. 



Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. Scorpio is the sign ruled by Pluto that explains why its power is especially visible putting essential decisions before the population of the Earth. Its message "Evolve or die" should be conveyed to everyone on the planet. This era is characterized by the last breaths of the Age of Pisces. Mankind has to realize that it is just not enough to reduce the CO 2 production by 30% over the next 25 years. Recent reports inform us that an increase in the average temperature of 1.3° Centigrade will cause climatic catastrophes, and that this is extremely likely to occur within the next 25 years. At this point, it is important to tap new sources of energy and to do more research on reproducible raw materials and make these available to the world. Hemp, which unfortunately, in spite of its potential, has been leading a miserable existence, is a reproducible raw material whose value is just beginning to be recognized. Hemp is being used to produce paper, soap, and clothing and even coffins all of which are 100% biodegradable. If people would redirect a fraction of the funds devoted to nuclear research to the research on the hemp plant, it would not only do a lot of good for mankind but also to our living environment. In Germany, it has become possible to cultivate hemp, but bureaucratic machinery seems to be effective at intimidating farmers who want to plant it; also there is not enough seed available.



The solution is simple, but it depends on whether mankind is able to recognize the seriousness of the situation. It may be time for young people to take the future of the planet into their own hands because they have their future ahead of them and will structure any progress more sensitively than our older representatives have been doing.

    <Text>Sagittarius stands for religion, worldview, spiritual insights and interactions, culture and intellectual well-being. People born under the sign, Sagittarius, should be able to come to an intense understanding of these values, especially now. At the present time, the effects of Sagittarius' energy have an increasing influence on the course of world events; intolerance in the form of fundamentalism is on the rise.  At the same time, there are movements to find internationally acceptable solutions to our problems, which include a reexamination of individual values. The future of humanity depends on whether people born during this time, and especially the people sitting at the controls of power, will be able to negotiate a consensus between people. This consensus must be based on respect, tolerance, a feeling of community and the establishment of uncompromisable human rights. Thereby the "Western" values of a progress-oriented modern society, which have long been uncritically seen as a blessing for the entire world, may not be imposed on foreign cultures.



Instead of emphasizing the differences, it would be better if all the inhabitants of this planet accept the world community. Each one should start with oneself, especially today when the world is continuously getting smaller and contact to foreigners, foreign cultures and various religious communities has become a part of daily life. This presents an opportunity for the people of this era to carefully reconsider their conduct and avoid subconsciously clinging to outdated prejudices. When the world society is challenged, the positive powers of Pluto in Sagittarius will unfold and create a new collective consciousness.



The solution is simple, but it depends on whether mankind is able to recognize the seriousness of the situation. It may be time for young people to take the future of the planet into their own hands because they have their future ahead of them and will structure any progress more sensitively than our older representatives have been doing.

    <Text>Major transformations in your life which you are unable to control, and which also make you unsure about everything, may make you start believing in fate. Regularly dealing with death, misuse of power and the likes brings you strength of character and self-confidence. Sexuality is also important to you and serves as a source of strength.



On your way, no catastrophe can throw you off track. There are always enough energy reserves to get you going again, and you do not need to fear the future. You have learned to let go of the past because it is better to let sleeping dogs lie, especially when the present is challenging enough.

    <Text>Through your intuition and willpower, you are in the position to recognize and see through to the basic relationships of life and assert your interests. For this reason, you can tap into the underlying sources of universal power and are able to use them to regenerate at anytime, if it is possible to do so without causing suffering. People think of you as a punching clown because you always manage to recover quickly from the greatest crisis.



There could be a danger of attempting to manipulate your environment. Although you could be quite successful at it, Pluto being the planet of the masses, it will not help you if you were to use this talent for your own egotistical ambitions. This is why you are especially suited to represent the interests of large groups of people, which will eventually earn you the acceptance of others.

In a classical sense, Pluto at the MC points to activity in atomic physics, still Pluto is involved with everything that has depth. Probably you have intuitive energy that you should definitely put to use in a way that will benefit everybody, or else it could have negative consequences for you.



Pluto deals with renewal; its position at the MC may mean that your status will constantly be changing. Possibly you will also often change your professional field. Even if the people closest to you do not react with a lot of understanding, you are convinced that it is necessary.

Although you understand that it is important to let go of the past and draw consequences from events, it is difficult for you to change. Strong forces tie you to the past and make you invest a lot of effort into giving your life a new direction. Your interest in life's essentials such as death, sexuality and reincarnation could help you. The challenge is to make radical changes to your life and, if you suffer from compulsive behavior, to look for its cause.

At the same time others will try to push their beliefs on you. This is why you should be careful whom you get involved with. The problem with it is that you place high expectations on others, and object if they come up with similar requests.



If you could somehow bring yourself to work in the interests of a lot of people, you would be more accepted and you could free yourself from the negative influences of the people around you. Try to keep your egotism under control and do not let yourself become a victim of anyone else's egotism.

Probably, you will have to change the way you deal with unexpected situations.  Clinging to old structures and ignoring opportunities for development which present themselves will bring you many trials. If you have a tendency to use other people's resources for your goals, you will eventually have to pay the price.

    <TextId>Your Pluto in the First House</TextId>
    <Text>Pluto, as the planet of regeneration and transformation, gives you a strong personality with extreme character traits. There is power hidden within you which can be used both for creative or destructive acts. If something manages to survive, you show no mercy and let it go under, whether it is ideas, relationships or possessions. Wake up and become aware of this side of your character, because you could be influencing others to behave destructively or provoke situations that have this effect. Do not live beyond your own capacity. Be more careful about how you invest your energy and remember that not everyone can withstand as much as you.



The first house describes the natural personality development of the chart owner which is why you should accept your Plutonian powers and integrate them into your personality. This is the only way to keep your overwhelming passions under control. Fortunately, you have the capacity to do a lot of good, because you have no problems letting go of the past and looking for new challenges. Just as you give in to desperation and destructive outrage, you could allow positive, worthy creations to grow. If you to express your emotions immediately and not wait until the volcano erupts, you will set a lot of things in motion during your lifetime. Probably you have an aura of dark power that does not go unnoticed.

Reconsider your attitude toward money and possessions and think about what they mean to you.



Pluto in the second house could burst all your fantasies of wealth. Probably experience will force you to learn detachment thereby teaching you the value of a home life. Extreme experiences in this respect could change your entire outlook on life. It is your fate to experience both wealth and poverty. Giving in to your need for security will only make detachment more painful. Watch out that you do not misuse your funds or try to buy people. There is a real danger of temptation to satisfy your power hunger by manipulating people with money, worshipping status symbols or resorting to deceit. Learning Pluto's lessons will enable you to use the means you have for the benefit of humanity and transform society's waste into treasures.

    <Text>Unfortunately, you have a tendency to vent your aggression verbally and do a lot of damage. Perhaps you have never noticed the effect of your words, although you have certainly hurt others. Pay attention to your motivation in expanding on the argumentation of the person you are talking to or riding her weaknesses. When you fight, you may prefer to be loud because this lets you feel the energy. You have a pronounced intellect and a capacity to differentiate. A constant occupation with intellectual work presents no problems for you, which is why you could also work in research. Mentally, you often question everything that happens and try to imagine alternatives. Do not sink too deeply into melancholy or other negative thoughts, because it could have a destructive effect on you.



You can exercise a strong influence on people but you should accept the freedom of thought and the will of others. Do not delve too deeply into strange thoughts.



Maybe in your childhood you suffered from an overactive imagination, but could not tell your family about it because you had a difficult relationship with them. Also you might have felt responsible for the death of other people and have developed a guilt complex.

    <Text>Probably you had generational conflicts with your parents and could not afford to make yourself vulnerable by admitting your feelings. Especially your mother was dominating and could not be pleased. This could have given rise to your crusade against family traditions that placed the foundations of everything which people were trying to teach you in question. If conflicts of this nature are still unresolved, it would be advisable to sit down with your parents and work on it. Otherwise, you run the risk of letting your frustration out on your family. If you develop a thirst for power, you may let it out on the people nearest to you. You are inclined to hide your emotions and intentions and can turn into a tyrant when at home with your family. Pluto in the fourth house can lead to a larger conflict with your family as a consequence of your behavior. Maybe you need this experience to wake up and consequently take a closer look at what happened in your childhood.



It does not necessarily have to be like that if you manage to find your spiritual balance and are made aware of the problem. You also have the capacity to keep your family together during crises and to use arising conflicts as experience for personal growth.

If the feeling stems from a hidden inferiority complex or if you really overestimate your talents, may remain unanswered for the time-being. It is still sometimes very difficult to develop a realistic self-image and stay relaxed in large groups of people. You like to appear in public and would like to take part in the creation of public life, whereby you may actually be more interested in feeling important. If you are hurt, you tend to uncontrolled outbreaks and will even risk losing a friendship in order to satisfy your thirst for revenge.



Thoughts about the effects of your works often distract too much from the actual content of your creative work. Probably you have not recognized your real talent but concentrate on the form which promises the most success. Simply do that which is the most fun.



Children can cause an upheaval in your life. There is a real danger that you want to dominate them and occupy a large part of their consciousness, or you regret the limitations on your freedom in general and on your ability to pursue your interests. On the other hand, children can inspire you to create artwork that moves everyone who sees it. If you use the rejuvenating power of Pluto, its creativity will help you to make great developments in your character and also help you find your true self.

It is possible with Pluto in this house that you keep on going, testing the limits of your endurance until you collapse or are forced to give in to your body's demands and rest in a sickbed. Remember how closely body and mind are connected and do not wait until your forced to your knees but stay healthy by strengthening your immune system and maintaining an internal balance.



This will not always be easy because once you have taken on a project you feel obliged to devote yourself entirely to it until every detail is completed. The sense of the project may no longer be clear because you are so busy analyzing the details. If you cannot put a check on it, everything will run through your fingers like sand and you will have to seriously ask yourself what meaning you have given to your life. If you presented yourself as a martyr to others and have loaded yourself with every burden from their shoulders, you could be disappointed and treated with contempt.



The challenge is to see the real demands of everyday life and to resist the temptation to use them as an escape from your inner world. Bring the needs of your body and soul in harmony and avoid the dangers of Pluto. Live out its positive aspects by using its healing qualities that are dormant within you.

It will not be easy to find a balance between your ego and the union with Pluto in the house of relationships. This may crystallize as the attempts to dominate the relationship are played out and one of you gives in. Pluto does not like to make compromises, although this is exactly what is needed in a partnership. Even if a relationship is just beginning to blossom, you may throw yourself into it so vehemently as to scare your potential lover away.



The development of your personality depends on your relationships, the way they are run and the consequences that you draw from them. You need someone else to bolster your self-esteem and to tackle problems, some of which may have a long history. The transforming power of Pluto is expressed in your relationship to others. If it is ever going to get that far, you need to accept the unpleasant side of yourself, just as everybody must. In the relationship, this may take the form of jealousy, revenge, greed or envy. Once you have recognized this challenge, you will become a much-appreciated haven for your partner, especially in times of crises.

Your need to overcome restrictions and break taboos takes you into danger zones. The destructive power of Pluto can drive you to your knees and move you to transform your life overnight.



All of your driving energies should be channeled into attaining positive goals. It would be a shame to completely suppress emotions like jealousy, hate, envy or desire for revenge and ban them from consciousness, because these feelings are a part of life and may be inclined to show up at the most inopportune moments.



A strong will lets you achieve everything you set out to do. Be care that you do not advance at other people's expense, you may pay for it later. The more you depend on success to be happy, the greater the danger of losing everything quickly. Pluto will teach you to turn crises into personality productive development sessions, which you should not resist. Your extraordinary source of energy will help you to avoid getting taken down and even to stand by your friends. You have a wondrous capacity to share your resources communally and still receive a lot in return. You are careful about other people's financial affairs and guard against getting into arguments over money.



Fear of death may not occupy your thoughts because you feel very near to death. The system of eternal giving and taking has permeated to your innermost being to the point where you have become curious about what will happen to you after this life.

You could choose to follow a philosophy or a system of belief and become a fanatical warrior for your cause. However, the more passionate your involvement, the more painful it will be when you finally wake up. You may see God as a strict father figure that watches over you, demands obedience and punishes immediately. If your outlook on life has taken on these kinds of character traits your faith will suffer from sudden unforeseen events and take a step closer to the truth, which is so important to you.



Possibly you try to influence people by manipulation, misusing power and being intolerant of the followers of other religions. Also in this case, you will be forced into experiences which will teach you to tolerate and respect the free will of every individual.



Even if you tend to this kind of extreme form of behavior, seriously consider basic questions of ethics. You could enthusiastically approach a field of knowledge and become an expert on it. It is to be hoped that your wish will become true and you will receive an answer to all of your questions. Once you have formed your character you will not hesitate to pass on your insights for the benefit of others.

If you have no trust in human qualities, or believe that you are too sensitive to open yourself and show feelings like fear, then you will not rest until you have reached a position where you feel secure.



Pluto in the tenth house will foil your plans and force you to change your attitude about the outside world. That can happen when you lose your job and have to completely rethink everything. Possibly you are timid about public life, crawl into your house and put your light under a bushel. Even in this case, events will force you to take on life as well as the responsibility for yourself and others.



Probably your father had plutonic powers and appeared dominant, powerful and full of energy. Maybe you still work hard because you want to prove something to him.



You have the potential to use your determination and stamina to reach a powerful position, whether it is in public or hidden in the remote areas of power. Guard against influencing the lives of other people reducing them to chess pieces; you will not get away with it.

    <Text>Groups could utilize you as a driving force for dynamic processes. For this reason, you will always play a central role in any group you join. The most important experiences of your life will be in this area. However, your behavior in the group will not be without problems, which can manifest themselves in different ways. Determination and drive for power may tempt you to try to dominate every group, including your friends and colleagues. Groups which are anything but harmless, may draw you into their megalomaniac plans with spiritual or political goals. Lovers may be incensed about the way you carry sexuality into the group and provoke jealousy, or are only able to find friends through sexual activity. The group could wind up taking out their negative energy on you and then using you as a scapegoat.



No matter which mechanisms are used, these sudden unforeseen events will force you to reconsider your behavior and your motivations and eventually make changes. One day you may find yourself completely isolated and then have to invest a lot of energy into finding another circle of people with similar convictions.



Through such experiences you will develop your character and attain a realistic self-awareness. Disputes within a group and even serious conflicts will help you learn to accept your weaknesses. Still you are able to remain loyal to your friends and to show strength and involvement especially in crises.

    <Text>Pluto in the twelfth house demands you to confront your inner conflicts and to learn how you can overcome yourself and detach from material possessions or even your own life. Delve deep into your subconscious and ask how you can conquer your inhibitions and live out everything currently slumbering within you. Maybe you are afraid to admit to your less positive side and fear being overwhelmed by emotions and passions. If placed under pressure you tend to escape into isolation and will never get to know yourself and miss a lot of opportunities. Become aware that the potential for many creative acts is hidden within you and could have a positive influence on the people around you.



The way to this consciousness leads you to the dissolution of out-dated behavior and personality structures. Go after greater ideas and forget your ego in order to tap into energy sources. Maybe you are suffering from an overpowering fear of death as an eternal sign of your fear of self-annihilation. This offers an approach to the task of clarifying yourself and bringing your hidden qualities to light.



Like no other, you are capable of learning through pain and crises and arising like a phoenix out of the ashes.

    <TextId>The Moon's Nodes - The Karmic Component - Where Do I Come From - Where Am I Going?</TextId>
    <Text>The Moon's nodes are points where the moon's orbit around the Earth crosses the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The points are calculated and lie directly across from each other. When these two points are connected, the Moon Node Axis crosses the entire chart. It runs backwards, from Aries into Pisces, then into Aquarius, etc.



The Moon Node Axis can travel through the horoscope in 18.5 years, which leaves 1.5 years in each sign. The people our own age have their Moon Nodes in the same sign as we do, but not necessarily in the same house.



The rising Moon Node is referred to as the northern Moon Node or Dragon's Head. The falling Moon Node is called the southern Moon Node or Dragon's Tail. In Indian Astrology they are called Rahu and Ketu.



The meaning of the Moon Node Axis is tied closely to Karmic Astrology and is easier to understand in this context. It begins with a premonition that we are not on planet Earth for the first time, but that we have brought experiences from previous lives with us. In a horoscope the principle of reincarnation is described by the Moon Node Axis, whereby the falling Moon Node shows where the soul is coming from while the rising Moon Node describes where it is going to and our goals in this life. The Axis is the path we walk in this life. It can also be seen as a horoscope compressed into one line, which is expounded on by the remaining factors.



The rising Moon Node contains the sum of all the experiences from our past lives. This is why it seems more familiar to us than its complement. It represents all our favorite habits, which we cannot manage to free ourselves from, but which hamper our development, in other words our personal "way of least resistance". It is our duty to overcome our inner obstacles and pave the way for new experiences that go in a completely different direction, as we see on the opposing sign. We should endeavor to free ourselves from the chains of habit and look forward to unexplored harbors. The houses containing the Moon's Nodes tell us which areas we should further develop and where we are caught by transmitted behavior patterns.



One of the most interesting ways to see the personal horoscope is to look at how far we have come and then image what may lie in store for us.

    <Text>Your task in this life is to become an independent individual with clearly defined opinions and to pursue your ambitions enthusiastically. Previously, you oriented yourself on your surroundings, striving for recognition from others. This explains why you were often uncertain about your own needs. You sacrificed your identity to a desire to be encompassed by harmony; this dependency made you exploitable. You became a master of compromises designed to synthesize everything into one mass. You probably have spent a lot of time in cultivated circles, well isolated from anything rough. You are used to being accepted by a group and react naively to approval; you are too uncritical of its source.



It is high time to make some changes. You may have to learn to push on with determination, not caring if others follow you or not. It is exceedingly important for you to establish an identity and take charge of your own life. Try to get over your dependency on other people's approval, be confident that your first step will not leave you isolated.

    <Text>This Moon Node position challenges you to stabilize your values during your lifetime and to overcome temptations to misuse power or let yourself be manipulated. Pay more attention to your mundane existence. Learn to respect other people's free will. This is especially important because people with weaker characters may find your aura of authority attractive.



Previously, you had difficulty controlling your drives and may even have been drawn to dark powers. You find yourself trapped in a web of dependencies and must first complete a process of transformation before you will be ready to devote another earthly existence to your education and development. Some dramatic experiences may have taught you to distrust the majority of people and to react defensively.



Use the earthy qualities of the sign Taurus and allow yourself the freedom to enjoy some of the less harmful pleasures in life. You have got to get control of yourself and to get back to the basics of human existence. If you can manage to invest your amazing powers solely in constructive endeavors, your experiences will teach you the true meaning of permanence.

    <Text>Previously you pretentiously assumed that your wisdom would bring the salvation of humanity and earn you historical recognition. You were even willing to bear every frustration, as well as isolation after each and every friend turned away from you. Convinced that you were capable of receiving enlightenment in passing, you never stopped to consider or even to listen to the opinions of others. Any criticism on your intellectual creations was immediately taken as a personal affront. All in all your unbridled arrogance has become your greatest trap.



It is extremely difficult to find a way to break such a pattern of behavior. More contact and more communication with others will help you to see things from the other side and recognize other facets of the truth. True involvement in your community will depend on your learning to value restraint and tolerance. This will also involve exchanging your fear of losing your prized independence for an understanding of the value of bonding with other people.

    <Text>This incarnation will give you the opportunity to learn to express your feelings freely and to allow other people to get close to you, especially your own family. Earlier you remained icily distant from everyone around you, rigid in your high social standing. You also tended to judge people by their status. Spontaneity and natural joy were foreign concepts to you, lost in your ambitions to redeem the respect you felt worthy of. You would go to any lengths to achieve your goals even if it involved infringing on the needs of those around you. You were a loner even in the company of others.



This could all change if you would only give up your activities in the community and dedicate yourself to giving back to your family and showing a little appreciation for the support you have received from them. Take some real responsibility for those around you without asking what is in it for you. You will develop imagination and sensitivity and finally bring an end to your spiritual isolation. Once you have overcome your false pride and self-righteousness you will be capable of loving life and emotional involvement.

    <Text>You know how it feels to work towards common goals in a large group. In spite of your unconventional ways, experience has convinced you that constant activity in your circle of friends or in a large group is the most efficient way to get things done.



In the past you had only little time for your private affairs and were also hesitant if not even a little bit afraid to work toward realizing your own individual goals. You usually stayed focused on the interests of all humanity and perform altruistic service while maintaining emotional distance. Unfortunately, you also tended to waste a lot of energy because your goals were not clearly defined.



Now is the time to become more concrete and separate from the masses. Your new experiences will lead you to attain independence and allow your individuality to surface. To achieve success, break away from the crowd and go your own way. You will eventually be recognized for your efforts by people willing to follow you. In time you will discover pragmatism and fairness and how to make use of them. Even if you work to realize your private ambitions, it will not necessarily have a less positive effect on your environment as your unyielding attempts to alter society.

    <Text>This Moon Node position challenges you to make clear, rational decisions taking leave of your emotional martyrdom. You are held captive by illusions and allow yourself to be caught up in tragic tales. You cannot express your position in front of others because you are very seldom capable of recognizing what your positions actually are. These veils of uncontrolled emotionality often lead to exploitation, leaving you unable to defend yourself. Resolution and ambition were alien concepts. Having closed your eyes to reality, you could not understand the cause of your suffering. Your being was unattainable and your self-pity only added to your isolation. Lack of self-confidence and your willingness to allow emotions to control your ideas inhibited your development. 



You are going to have to find a way out of this behavior pattern. You cannot run from the truth, even if it is not always pleasant. Do not let yourself be swayed by other people's moods. Practice saying no to yourself and to those asking for favors. You have to learn to think critically and to define your goals clearly if you ever want to reach them. Analyze the situation in order to differentiate between pity and sympathy. If you want to help then go to a hospital or similar institution and offer concrete help to people who really need it.

You stumble through life oblivious to the consequences, accompanied by the feeling that you are being shortchanged or are missing out on something. You can hurt others with your thoughtlessness without even being aware that you are doing it. Your lack of sensitivity makes you seem cruel and prevents others from developing interest in you beyond staring at you in amazement. Your lack of restraint in expressing aggression makes life with you difficult, as does your tendency to think that someone will take something away from you if you do not make a grab for it first.



Now you have the chance to recognize what you have been doing and rethink your behavior. You should try to be more quiet and take time to listen to others and reflect. You should maintain balance between your own needs and those of others. Learn to make compromises and do not always think that your interests are being sacrificed. If you wait and watch you might see that someone else would like to have that last piece of cake, you will be amazed at how much you can achieve without even having to fight for it.

    <Text>Previously you were attached to your possessions and material successes and had no concern for your spiritual development. Work was hard and persistent leaving you prone to rest after receiving your reward. A decadent lifestyle and preoccupation with your own physical comfort kept you from seeing other more important values. You were not interested in becoming enlightened, but were happy to be made a slave to wealth. All change was painstakingly avoided, because the risk of losing something seemed high enough to prevent you from even trying to overcome your inertia. You were satisfied to keep all your routines, suspiciously watching anything unfamiliar.



Your task is to learn to accept the flow of change and to prepare a comprehensive spiritual transformation. Open yourself to new experiences and learn to be detached if you want to profit from life's lessons. If you do not comply voluntarily, circumstances may eventually force you into it.



Earthly existence is an adventure, in which winning always implies some risk. Extreme situations will reveal your strengths and help you to develop abilities that will prove to be effective. Newly acquired free space will allow your energies to unfold and reach their full potential.

    <Text>Your task in this life is to overcome your indecisiveness and take a firm standpoint. Before, you approached strangers and freely exchanged ideas with them. The problem arose when you tended to let yourself be convinced too easily, and ended up repeating what was being said to you in order to gain approval. That was no problem for you because you were unable to establish a personal relationship to the contents of the conversation. Thus you earned a reputation for being superficial, never taking anything seriously. You suffered from your own inner conflicts and your ability to see everything from every perspective. Frequently, you had no idea what you actually wanted, searching for your own well being in a multitude of activities. Still you were unable to commit yourself, always choosing to remain on the sidelines.



Now is the time to begin your search for truth. Silence is preferable to joining a discussion with an offhand comment that you may regret later. If you want to gain deeper insights, you are going to have to be more honest with people. It may be necessary to withdraw for a while until you have found yourself. Expand your horizons and do not be satisfied to occupy yourself with trivialities. Better alternatives would be to take a long trip or to study sophisticated literature. You will learn your lessons and develop firm opinions through patience and determined effort.

    <Text>Your challenge in this life is to attain maturity and responsibility, leaving childlike behavior behind. Your moods have been making it impossible for others to figure you out, especially with your stubborn refusal to exchange the weaknesses you have acquired for more resolute and reasonable behavior. You have been prone to twist the truth to suit your needs and then become furious when things went differently than you expected. Because you are barely getting by on your own, you are inclined to put your fate in the hands of stronger people who are willing to look after you. You have a tendency to be obstinate in defiance of every logic, which only hurts you. The fear of retaliation for your behavior has kept you from going out. You much prefer to throw a fit in the privacy of your own home. You wished that everything would return to the way it was.



The time for change has come. You are challenged to find a place in society and take yourself seriously. Go out and confront yourself with the consequences of your behavior; this will in turn force you to act more reasonably. You have to recognize that there are more important things than your personal insignificant affairs and that important duties await you. You can no longer evade your responsibility. You are asked to take it on lightheartedly, as no one can relieve you.

    <Text>In the past you have managed to place your own interests in the center of every activity, disregarding the rest of the world. You insisted on setting the pace and were unable to let yourself be led by anyone else and inept at cooperation among equals. Your lust for power and excessive pride let you forget how much real friendship could give you and how wonderful life within a community can be. Your conceit led you to find a role in any drama that would make you the center of attention. You were not even able to admit to the same weaknesses in yourself, which you despised in others.



Now you are called upon to sacrifice your own personal goals to service for your community. Descend from your pedestal and meet with the "lesser" folk. You could learn more than you dare to imagine. Your duty is to devote your managerial qualities to the development of a more humane society and subdue your ego in support of a nobler goal. This will require letting your mask fall as well resisting the temptation to dominate others. You must learn to think of yourself as a small part of the universe, which can attain its destiny only through a cooperative effort with friends and partners. Any attempts to resist may result in an involuntary isolation that will eventually force you into taking these very steps.

    <Text>The lesson for this life is to become less stubborn and open yourself for spiritual development in order to feel sincere sympathy for others. 



This could be complicated by the fact that you have made a habit of living by strict rules. It would be better to reexamine the rules critically before accepting them as a standard. Order and duty determine your life to a large extent. Even when helping someone, it is out of a sense of duty, because such things are expected. Your innate distrust should help you to avoid the dangers of this world, but at the same time it cancels out sincerity and the ability to love. You want everything to be explainable and easily within reach. A consciousness that extends beyond the limits of your sensory perception is beyond imagining.



Events of this life have been constructed to prove that you can increase your sensibility. Some trust in your intuition and a little dedication could open new worlds and grant you access to the inner processes of the people around you. If you open yourself up and loosen the rigid structures within you, the reward will be the ability to recognize the oneness of the universe and to offer love and sympathy for all the inhabitants of the Earth.

Do not fall into the old habit of relying on approval from your partner, but encourage your own strengths. Exercising solidarity in the realization of your goals is not the point. Rather, you are asked to achieve independence through a confident appearance and to live according to your needs. Even if you still put yourself under pressure to become one with your partner, take the initiative and accept the challenge of self-fulfillment. If you should want to have another relationship, you will be able to contribute more without running the risk of being used.

It is important for you to see tangible results. Otherwise your jealousy of other people's success will only make your life more difficult. Be willing to work long and hard for a comfortable home and work responsibly. Under no circumstances let yourself be seduced to use your influence over people to profit from their energy or let your spiritual powers make you arrogant. Be humble and recognize the worth of hard-earned success.

The challenge is to communicate on an everyday level and present your knowledge in a way that can be utilized. Do not believe that you are intellectually superior to others, but be willing to consider their ideas and suggestions.



In relationships, your need for freedom gives you a feeling of being chained or even oppressed before very long. It is important to be able to find workable compromises to reconcile your concept of freedom with the needs of your partner. Get down to the fundamentals of spiritual reality; do not let anyone convince you that spiritual development is only possible in distant places.

Your family has needs beyond stability and a firm financial basis, but also love, sympathy and openness. Be tolerant of human weaknesses and do not always try to be a rock of stability for everyone around you. Give in to the flow of life with all of its changes and do not try to set positions for all eternity.

Your imagination should enable you to spend contented hours in romantic relationships as well as live out your moods erotically. With your childlike character, you are probably good with children and prefer any fantasy world to reality. This is why you should learn to think realistically.



Sometimes you feel torn between doing something for yourself and helping others. You will learn that this does not necessarily imply a contradiction, if you remain sincere.

Thoroughness and responsibility may not sound very appealing, but it is important for you to fulfill your everyday routines consequently, and so avoid creating chaos. Your sensitivity keeps you from maintaining distance and following logical conclusions. On the other hand, you have the capacity for spiritual development once you detach yourself from the past and recognize the real opportunity that this incarnation offers.

Consideration and the ability to cooperate probably are not your primary strengths, but they are absolutely essential to a loving relationship. This does not imply that you are expected to act selflessly. The goal is to find a balance between independence and partnership which both can accept. It is also important to develop more endurance when it comes to investing in a relationship and not to throw everything overboard at the first conflict. You will see that warmth and trust grow slowly and that accepting minor inconveniences pays off in the long run.

The point is to let go of the security you have come to love and build up enough courage to set out in new directions and expose yourself new and different experiences. Look for extreme situations where you can discover your true self and overcome your inflated possessiveness. Subdue the obstinacy you developed in the past or you can count on an escalation of the conflicts you will have to face.



Especially in the area of sexuality, you will recognize that giving yourself completely to emotional experiences can lead to transformations. Let your instinct be your guide and you will discover immense energy deep within your being.

Expand your horizons and fervently work to realize your ambitions. A sense of justice and love of truth will accompany you on your way. You have the potential to attain complete intellectual freedom and to be rid off the feeling of dependency on your community. Withstand the pressure to turn your mind into a portable library filled with facts; do not ignore the voice of your heart while making decisions. If you succeed you will have the opportunity to share your insights with others.

Your ego will not do you any service in this life, but has to be overcome in order to free your strengths and imagination for service to the community. Use your power of reason and avoid the distractions offered by romantic adventures that only serve to boost your self-confidence. You will then find that you can be very happy among your friends.

    <TextId>Lilith - The Suppressed Femininity</TextId>
    <Text>Lilith is not a planet but a calculated so called 'sensitive' point. Its position on the chart is determined by the elliptical orbit of the Moon around the Earth. First the points on the Moon's orbit furthest from the Earth are connected by an axis. Lilith is found at the point along this axis directly across from the Earth at the same distance from the center of the ellipse. Next to the Earth, this point is the second focal point on the Moon's orbit. Lilith's orbit takes 3232 days, about 8.9 years.



To interpret its position in the chart, it is important to know Lilith's history. She was Adam's first wife and was thrown out of Paradise because she refused to surrender to him on the grounds of her sex. She then lived with demons, with whom she bore innumerable children at the Red Sea. The angels sent from God eventually found her and demanded that she return to Adam. Lilith refused. As punishment one hundred of her children were killed each day. Lilith went mad with grief and commenced killing others. Her victims were women in childbed, small children and men, who she first seduced and then killed. Apart from that, she was also supposed to have appeared as a serpent in Paradise and offered Eve the apple from the tree of knowledge, which led to their expulsion from Paradise.



Also an additional name for Lilith offers insight into its meaning in the horoscope: Lilith is also called the Black Moon (and is illustrated as such) becoming the other, unseen side of femininity. She is not only the creator of life but also brings death, pain and disaster. She played an important role in the ancient Astrology of Babylon and Assyria, which was rediscovered as women in the sixties and seventies emancipated themselves, demanding the rights to regulate their own sexual behavior, birth control, abortion and demanded equal treatment. It is not surprising that women were attracted to Lilith nor that the literature on Lilith interpretations was written mainly by women.



In light of modern psychology, interpretations of Lilith's position tells us about unfulfilled wishes, the suppressed shadow-side of our personality, painful experiences, privation and darkness. As with Pluto, the processes triggered here should lead to self-recognition and the acceptance of our dark side. Good and bad should nt be differentiated from each other, but human existence should be seen as many-faceted.



In a man's horoscope, Lilith can reveal what type of woman he fears most and which type of woman can drive him to despair.

    <TextId>Chiron - The Social Attitude</TextId>
    <Text>Chiron is a relatively small celestial body discovered on the 1st of November 1977. Its orbit lies between Saturn and Uranus. Chiron takes between 50 and 51 years to orbit the Sun. Its elliptical orbit causes it to spend a varying duration of time in each sign. Chiron travels through Libra in no more than 18 months while it remains in Aries for eight years. Some Astrologers let Chiron rule the sign Virgo, others opt for Sagittarius.



The preliminary interpretations of Chiron have understandably not progressed too far. Its astrological exploration is just beginning. As with all the planets discovered in modern times, the general mood and the situation of the entire human race at the time of the discovery are taken into account in Chiron's interpretations. Chiron's symbol resembles a key. 



A second indication to its interpretation is its role in ancient mythology. Chiron was a Centaur, half human and half horse. He was a healer, astrologer, teacher, musician and warrior in one. The great heroes like Heracles, Achilles and Orpheus were all taught by him. He also founded the Asclepeion, a center where the sick were healed and medicine was taught. Interestingly enough, Chiron was wounded by an arrow shot by Heracles, which was dipped in a poison he himself discovered. Chiron suffered great pain, but him being immortal, could not die. He withdrew to a cave and was not freed from his agony until he willingly ascended to the underworld, Hades, in exchange for Prometheus' freedom.



As mentioned above, Chiron orbits the Sun between Saturn and Uranus; between the last inner planet and the first outer planet. This key position has granted Chiron the role as a bridge between the inner and outer planets. Through Chiron's experience the mysterious planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, become more accessible. The collective energies of these planets can be experienced and utilized with Chiron's help. 



A closer look at the time since Chiron's discovery reveals an intensive search for meaning. More and more individuals have come to understand the necessity of united insight and action. Thus, Chiron appears to be an inner guide offering light in the midst of darkness, opening the spirit for experiences beyond daily routine.



The development of a positive collective consciousness that alone can bring about the necessary upheaval to create a peaceful and secure future may, due to the discovery of Chiron, not remain merely a dream.



If you are interested in learning more about this topic, its best to start thinking about the position of Chiron in your own horoscope. You may discover key experiences which altered your thinking and perception. Special attention should be paid to Chiron's square aspects while in transit, which, according to the position of Chiron in the natal chart, may take place at different ages.

    <TextId>The Ascendant - Gate to the External World</TextId>
    <Text>The Ascendant is the rising sign in the East at the time of birth. It metaphorically channels our expectations of life. The first impression stays with us throughout the day, influencing each contact and every event. The Ascendant channels all the other energies in the chart actively working to express them. It describes the way we live our natal chart and how we confront our environment, making up an important part of our identity. 



As to the question of the differentiation between the Ascendant and the role of the Sun keep in mind how difficult it is for us as well as for others to differentiate the expression of our personality from our personality itself. This question can therefore only be partially resolved. It is much more important to live the positive aspects of your sign and to bring it into harmony with all the other energies and influences.

    <TextId>Your Ascendant in Aries</TextId>
    <Text>The driving force in the life of a person with an Aries Ascendant is the energy of Mars, which rules over Aries. You will most certainly notice the influence of its energy. The power wielded here is hardly rivaled in our universe. Especially anything new and foreign attracts and stimulates it.



Whether it is caused by its power or in spite of it, an Aries Ascendant creates dangers that can take two directions. You could develop an arrogance that prevents you from accepting suggestions and constructive criticism from the people around you. This type of behavior results from your drive for independence, which if unchecked, can swell into the delusion that you can get along without anybody in your life. The danger could also lie in the opposite direction. You may endeavor to fulfill all the expectations placed on you. This may come from a lack of self-confidence. You fail to notice how you put yourself under pressure with senseless rivalry.



It is important for you to direct your energy and abilities toward a worthy goal. Create peace in your innermost self and try to be as honest as possible, especially if you cannot bring yourself to listen to what others think.



You may have problems keeping up with your own fast pace and the spontaneous course changes in your life. The people around you will eventually lose patience and you will probably come to regret not ever having carried a sensible activity through to the finish. You run in circles and when whatever it is your doing becomes difficult, you toss it aside for some new endeavor.



On the other hand an Aries Ascendant brings you the valuable ability to keep your self-confidence in a critical environment and to see yourself as a complex being deeply in touch with yourself.

    <TextId>Your Ascendant in Taurus</TextId>
    <Text>Your Taurus Ascendant gives you a marked energy reserve; this is why you keep working and pursuing your goal when everyone else has long since given up. You are known for your determination, you love to work on long term projects and make promising investments. You are also a sensitive person and are very sympathetic to the plight of others.



Stability is an important theme in your life. But do not expect to find it in the outside world; this will only make you dependent on others or create a dependency on possessions. Becoming obsessed with collecting material things will cost you your freedom. On the other hand, concentrating on the needs of others could lead you to confuse your needs with theirs, losing yourself. Accept the flow of change in your life. Learn to let go of the past and you will find that flexibility is constantly offering new opportunities.



The negative expression of a Taurus Ascendant is an attachment to comfort and luxury. Your sensuous nature leads you to give in to life's pleasures where you tend to become obsessive. This can lead to compulsive behavior. In addition, you assume that everyone in the world has to see things the way you do. You waste your time with vain attempts to convince people, earning you a reputation for being stubborn and defiant.



The positive side of this Ascendant is best explained by recalling that Taurus is ruled by Venus. Your greatest talent must be accepting people wholeheartedly and without ulterior motives. Once you have found peace with yourself you can be quite generous. You are able to precisely identify the needs of others and offer them what they are lacking. You also have a sense for aesthetics and are musically talented. 



Your other talents are in quite different areas. You are practical and earthy. These qualities could enable you to create a solid foundation for your life providing you with the security you are longing for. You will find yourself by following your intuition and your heart. Feel free to express your inner harmony.

    <Text>You are an extroverted person, eloquent and interested in nearly everything. Still you feel like you are not progressing enough and are not informed enough about everything. You have not learned that the key to your development has to be found within yourself. Becoming a sponge, soaking up all the contradicting information and opinions in your environment, will only lead to inner confusion. If you begin to identify yourself with things that you have only recently found out about, others will find you flaky. 



You sometimes feel inferior. This is because you do not look at others critically but notice their good side first. You are often considered superficial, although you like people and your bubbling personality wins you a lot of friends. The problematic side of this Ascendant is the lack of direction, which allows you to become confused by the myriad possibilities offered in your surroundings and distracts you from consequently following your own path through life. Take care not to place too much emphasis on being witty. This might push people away who cannot grasp your sense of humor at first sight.



Arise to challenges and take the time to put your thoughts in order. This will allow you to commit yourself. You will not have to worry about your understanding for everything and everyone tearing you in different directions. Your clear and definite manner of speaking will help you to find the completeness you are seeking.

    <Text>Your Cancer Ascendant makes you seem moody and indecisive, like the Moon, which has its home in this sign. Your delicate nature is probably expressed in soft facial features. To live according to your true self you must keep in touch with your soul and avoid acting contrary to your intuition. This intuition will accompany you through your entire life. Your task lies in learning to differentiate when your inner voice is speaking out of a temporary mood or is expressing a basic need, which you should address in your plans. This will not be easy because you tend to take on other people's problems as your own. You always run the risk of being used, among other things, as an emotional garbage dump. Another quality of the sign Cancer is the tendency to cling to the past. With the wisdom of a mother of teenagers, avoid taking responsibility for people capable of taking care of themselves. If you give in to your caregiver instinct and continually disperse love and warmth, expect to be frequently disappointed and frustrated. You have difficulty maintaining distance from situations and people and are extremely vulnerable, easily offended and quickly feel rejected. It would be a good idea to develop a thicker skin; it most certainly would not do any harm. Use your brain before tuning into the mood of the people who are close to you, although your sensitive nature may make this difficult.



Once you have overcome your uncertainty and found your center, you need not hesitate to follow whims of your spiritual life. Feelings will guide you through life, because your Cancer Ascendant, as a symbol of fertility and birth, will keep you in touch with the tides of life.

    <Text>You radiate energy like the Sun and attract people with your creativity, optimism and leadership capabilities. You are often more successful than others, who have trouble getting off the sidelines. You have no problem doing just that, you love being the center of attention and need to rant about on center stage. With your charisma, you will not be overlooked.



Do not deceive yourself: Your behavior holds traps for you; your inclination is to be overconfident and not notice how ridiculous your power struggles are. If you want to achieve the greatness of which you are capable, then you will have to learn to use your extraordinary talents responsibly. That will prevent you from acquiring a false pride, seeing the world as a stage and defying reality to bask in narcissism. It would be a shame if you waste your energy only to draw the envy of your "subjects".



You should make it a habit to frequently step back and practice humility. Let someone else have a turn and look on calmly. You need to relax more, no one can hold out controlling everything for very long.



It is important for you to surround yourself with friends who do not hesitate to tell you what they really think and have enough confidence to raise the stakes during a confrontation, not simply applauding you. These friends will help you to recognize what you can actually achieve and help you set sensible goals that will establish relationships based on trust. If you manage that, your natural powers, inspiration and creativity will radiate more strongly than you ever imagined possible.

    <Text>Probably you are often accused of being reserved and too shy and of taking things too seriously. You do not come on as being especially spontaneous and flamboyant. You have trouble simply enjoying the pleasures of life without serious contemplation. This lies in your inclination to worry too much and to always want to have an overview of everything that is happening. This prevents you from relaxing, because your brain keeps on churning. However, this brain has astounding capabilities. You analyze details which others have not even recognized. Your strength is rational thinking. When you are living from your center, others can rely on your judgement. Then you are able to organize your thoughts, refrain from pageantry and not let yourself get distracted from your ambitions.



It may take a long time to reach this point. Your task is to accept the "chaos" principle you run into everywhere, which lends chaos to its own kind of organization.



Overcome your resistance to ideas that you cannot understand or explain. Look inside yourself before you jump to criticize. It is for you to learn that your standards are not the only valid ones and that humans are not perfect machines. Try to accept life's imperfections and do not lose sight of the whole picture by concentrating on details.



Once you have accomplished this, you have done your duty. No one is asked for more than to find an inner balance. You will then be able to recognize what is really important in life. Once you have been purified in this manner, you will be able to truly help others.

    <Text>Your Libra Ascendant gives you a pleasant exterior and a friendly, charming personality. You decorate your surroundings tastefully. It is no wonder that wherever you go people are glad to see you and so many people, especially the opposite sex, are attracted to you.



You are actually seething under this pleasant facade. This is because your high ideals demand a tranquil environment. You are making it difficult for yourself. You do not realize that you are chasing a dream and are preparing yourself for more and more frustration. You must learn to accept certain unpleasant truths. Consider how much you do for others to gain their acceptance and to raise your own self-esteem.



To achieve contentment with your life, you need to balance your needs with those of others, as the symbol of the scale suggests. Do not simply compromise with your bad feelings but examine their cause at its root. Become aware of your own needs to avoid assuming the needs of others as your own. You can give with astounding selflessness, once you have learned to take just as naturally. Remember that you do not have to make amends to anyone.



When trying to reach a goal, you should not battle frantically, but wait it out calmly. Unity and harmony cannot be forced. When you have realized this, you will become the most valuable gift you can give to anyone. Your willingness to sacrifice will leave no one untouched.

    <Text>You do not disappear in the crowd. Your extraordinary charm, dark and mysterious, makes you stand out. You are as original and interesting as you appear to be. You search for higher knowledge like an expedition from earlier times that fears no danger, constantly offering challenge to grow and develop.



You are accompanied by the energy of the planet Pluto, which guides you into depths no one else would dare to explore. You can take this risk because you command astounding regenerative powers and are willing to cross any barrier. There could be danger for you and others if you do go too far with this. When you are frustrated you become the most dangerous enemy, stabbing at the most vulnerable places. It is amazing that you seem to disregard yourself and inflict the worst wounds on yourself.



Your desire to continually develop often leaves you feeling discontented with your current state of consciousness. For this reason, you occasionally appear to be embittered, especially when you are unwilling to make compromises. You can be sure that your "everything or nothing" attitude is only getting in your way. You would do better if you tried being more lenient on occasion. Your friends will thank you. You will also be out of danger of becoming a loner. It is not necessary to lose your identity through identification with a group to avoid isolation, so do not scare people away.



You find strength in letting the cycles of life and death become a part of you. This enables you to let go when a cycle comes to an end. Use the significance of the principles of regeneration and transformation to guide yourself and others to develop healing qualities.

    <Text>You can tear through life like an excited child; with intuition and childlike naiveté you are able to disclose unseen truths. You are quick to recognize interconnections and then are able to express that concisely. You are generally spontaneous and witty, a people person, not the type to sit alone in a corner at a party. 



Not everything in your life runs as smoothly as it first appears. A Sagittarius is a mutable fire sign, which can make it difficult for you to stay with one activity over a period of time and not let yourself be distracted by the prospect of new adventures. The planet Jupiter that rules the sign Sagittarius has extraordinary influence through its principle of expansion; you are attracted by everything that crosses your path and is large or conspicuous. You like to use big words and exaggerate every narration. Even if people listen, because they find you entertaining, you should keep it down or risk that only half of what you say will be believed. 



Your behavior is based on your desire to get to know the world, gain deeper insights by understanding everything and find the truth. This brings you to travel often and take part in discussions on the meaning of life. You will not let yourself get tied down too soon; if the Earth element is a strong influence in your horoscope, you will save your dream of a house in the country for your old age.



You radiate hope and optimism. Be careful not to let it mislead you to ignore your failures and continue on in the same way. If you really want to gain insight, then get inside yourself and search there. The simple and unpretentious may be more valuable than you imagine. Finding your center will help you realize great truths that will also prove to be helpful to your friends.

    <Text>You do not rush into things but consider the consequences and let your sense of responsibility guide you. You are logical and consistent, but sometimes lack spontaneity and a sense of humor, so much so that you have problems with the "the unbearable lightness of being". It can go so far as to cause you vague feelings of guilt and to have inhibitions against letting your inner struggles surface. You do not approach others for light conversation.



Everything in your life should have meaning and permanence. To achieve this, you work unusually hard, sometimes embittered but always remaining loyal to your boss. These traits will secure your future in a high position. Your colleges may not always be pleased about this, unless you have realized that positive emotions are essential to our well being and everyone should try to overlook things on occasion. Emotional instability leads you to erect barriers around yourself. You would be better off if, instead of binding up your feelings in a corset of rules and regulations, you "come out" occasionally. Material values are not the only significant factor to creating happiness. Try really taking in the beauty of a rose without thinking about the next day at the office. You are not responsible for everything that does not work out.



You should learn not to pay too much attention to status symbols; these are often bought at a high price, namely at the cost of unfulfilled wishes. Consider whether you hold to traditional values out of conviction or if they only serve to create an illusion of security.



Strangely enough, you may loosen up in your old age and live a more youthful existence than you did when you were young. Your practical skills and sober outlook enable you to accomplish a lot for your community and find fulfillment. Your popularity will be at its highest when it does not matter to you any more.

    <Text>Innovation and progress are very important to you. You like to see yourself as the instigator of new ideas, developments and societal reforms. You reveal yourself as unconventional and take pleasure in relaxing rigid social pressures and proclaiming a new avant-garde lifestyle. As Aquarius is an air sign, you can let your intuition guide you in your endeavors, which will most likely be intellectual. You feel best when working with a group of people of similar convictions. This brings you to collective movements born in the spirit of the times, even though you object to taking a position in a hierarchy.



Personal and intellectual freedoms are priorities for you. This is evident in your active participation in experiments and exploration. Simply hearing the justification "because it has always been that way" gets on your nerves and incites rebellion. By constantly getting into new areas, you run the risk of taking on more than you can handle without gaining expertise in any one area. You can also be accused of not allowing anyone to get close to you; you certainly tend to approach both people and situations from a distance. It is probably a protective mechanism to keep too many rapid developments from affecting you personally and getting you confused.



You should take measures not to question tradition too quickly, destroying this without having a better alternative to offer. Remember that you are a product of this tradition and are therefore, at least in some respects, dependent. Once you have managed a somber, more patient approach, you will be able to regulate things to take your individuality into consideration and leave you with enough freedom. Until then be wary of flattery, even if you find it alluring. You can find other ways to recognize your worth within your own circle of friends.

    <Text>You are a very sensitive and imaginative person and sometimes make the impression of moving not entirely on the planet Earth. Your skin is simply not thick enough to protect you from all the various influences storming in on you, which leave you somewhat confused.



Opening yourself up completely to all external events will have a negative impact. This is because you have difficulty limiting your involvement and become even more confused and destabilized; it can go so far as to cause you to seriously doubt yourself. It is extremely important for you to find a relatively safe path through life and not to unconditionally follow some guru, as you like to give in to illusions.



Once you have removed these perilous cliffs from the landscape, you can let your true self unfold. If you want a clearer image of what this could mean, remember that the last two thousand years of Christianity were called the Age of Pisces. The figure, Jesus Christ, explains better than any attempt to go into the symbolism of the sign of Pisces. You have this potential in a milder form.



When you meet people, do not make your judgment on exterior circumstances, but try to experience them for what they are. In order to do this, you have to gain more stability and self-confidence. You have a cowardly nature, but in a challenging situation you can get up so much courage that you probably even amaze yourself. 



Your greatest talent is your endless imagination. If you should dare to channel it into creative endeavors, you will find it to be not only exciting but also useful. Your inspirations would enrich every type of art.



The principle of dissolution is associated with the sign Pisces. The interpretation of this should be left entirely up to you.

    <Text>The Medium Coeli also called MC or Midheaven refers to the highest point on the chart. It is the point of culmination where the planets reach the point on their apparent orbits highest above the horizon. This point also forms the summit or the beginning (cusp) of the tenth house. Directly across, the lowest point of the chart is found at the beginning (cusp) of the fourth house, the Imum Coeli or IC. The MC generally symbolizes the consciousness while the IC represents the subconscious.



The position of the MC on your chart can reveal how you conduct yourself in the outside world. This includes your role in public, your professional career, and your social position and in some cases your rate of success. The MC describes your professional orientation, where your talents lie and how you go about planning your career. There is also information about the relevance of other people's opinions and tells if you are persistent and/or determined.



A precise interpretation of your professional ambitions must include the positions of the planets in the tenth house and the aspects between the rest of the heavenly bodies.



The interpretation contains a listing of professions associated with the MC in classical Astrology. Whereby you should not consider the name of the profession as it appears in the list, but the abilities which are relevant to each of the professional fields.

    <Text>You would like to pursue a career out of preparing the way for new ideas. Maybe you have not had any training for a recognized profession, but trust your intuition and start your own business. This makes especially good sense because your willfulness will make it hard to take orders from the boss. You much prefer making your own decisions.



You always want to force through any achievements you expect even in spite of the intense competition. You are not exactly known for being squeamish. Consideration is not one of your strong points, which is why you prefer working alone to teamwork. It is also possible that no one else can keep up with your pace. You tend to act spontaneously, without taking time to think things over first. You hate tedious planning, preferring to set things in motion with no concern for the consequences.



Your persistence is not your strong point. If you are not successful, you do not hesitate to give up and start something new. Work is not supposed to be boring, you need the challenge and are constantly out to prove your capability. Your ambition is to reach the top and you never doubt your chances even for a moment. You put a lot of energy into your professional interests, and also have great physical stamina. You may work in a technical profession, in the military or in sports. Your determination could make you a leader.



To find out to what extent these character traits define you, consult the position of Mars and its Aspects in your chart a little more closely.

    <Text>Steady employment is important for the fulfillment of your material needs. You are not opposed to working up to a position slowly, as long as it has a future. Professional endeavors should be practical, which is why you set your sights on the tried and proven rather than taking any risks. Abstract instructions are hard for you to understand, because you think and work practically. You may not be very imaginative, but are most certainly a realist.



You could take over an important position in a company because you have proven your reliability. Once you take on something, you work at it for as long as it takes until it is done. You are likely to stay at your position for a long time because you do not like having to adjust to new situations. You can be loyal to your boss and get along well with your colleagues because you are humble and uncomplicated. You need both harmony at work and also the feeling of accomplishment. At the end of the day you like to take time to reflect on your accomplishments of the day.



Forming materials fascinates you. You like working with your hands and are artistically talented. Your sense for aesthetics could lead to a career in fashion, art, horticulture or agriculture. Banking could also interest you.

    <Text>Your career could be characterized by constant changes. It is not particularly hard for you to find your bearings in a temporary situation and take on new endeavors. On the other hand, getting stuck with routine, tedious work or having to bridge dry spells in the company frustrates you. You need constant intellectual stimulation, learn fast and are willing to devote time to professional training. The only problem with all this stimulation is that everything interests you and it is therefore difficult for you to commit yourself to a single goal. You may put off deciding on a profession because within a short period of time something else will seem more attractive. This will make it improbable that you will ever climb very high up the corporate ladder. You are easily distracted and unable to commit yourself. Still, your career takes a back seat to entertainment and other leisure activities.



No matter what you are doing you like to be surrounded by people and enjoy the exchange of opinions and participate enthusiastically on whatever is going on. You are friendly with your colleagues, occasionally spending evenings together after work.



To find out the extent of influence of these character traits, check the position of Mercury and the Aspects between the remaining planets in your chart.



Gemini on the MC can point to a career in media, advertising, the tourism industry or in translation. All these professions require mental flexibility and a talent for communication.

    <Text>You will choose your profession by feeling it out. Planning and strategy are not your style. You bear the responsibility for everything you do and want to devote yourself to it with all your heart and soul. Of course, you greatly prefer working with people to working with machines. You do your best to avoid competition. If you do not feel accepted, you simply leave your position. Not pursuing any particular goal, your career may well be marked by interruptions and changes of direction. The most important criterion is that you feel at ease with the atmosphere at work; the career is secondary. You may not have enough energy for career goals because your private life takes so much out of you. You also suffer from a lack of confidence.



If you should get into a leadership position in spite of all this, you will have to be careful not to let your moods confuse your employees and cause frustration. On the other hand your convictions and your inherent sense of responsibility will always motivate you to find time for the betterment of humankind. With the MC in the sign Cancer you could be a successful nutrition consultant. Work with children, nursing or the food industry would probably also interest you.



Take a closer look at the position of the Moon and the Aspects between the other planets in your chart to determine the influence of these character traits.

    <Text>You were born to be the boss, giving directions comes to you naturally. Your sovereignty probably does not leave room for many contradictions to your authority, which is just as well if your employees value their jobs. Your determination and ambition help you to achieve whatever you set out to do. Your success may be due to your highly developed confidence and your talent for always placing yourself in the most positive light. You know how to make useful contacts and are popular because you like people who are open and entertaining.



Working creatively and developing your own ideas is not something you want to give up. You are proud of your ability to consequently make decisions and then defend them. Your consistent successes allow you to treat problems playfully, because you are sure that a solution is at hand. Work on keeping your ego from inflating and seeing every justified point of criticism as desecration of your infallibility.



Your professional success is accompanied by a rise in social status that includes public demonstrations that are no problem because you are adept at spending money.



You could be active in management, deal in art, work in sports or with children or start your own business.

    <Text>You plan your career carefully and progress one step at a time. Probably you will enter a traditional profession, making a "reasonable" choice. It is not difficult for you to be patient and you wait a long time for the success you have earned. Your ambitions regarding promotions remain in bounds, but you could reach the top because you do not let yourself be distracted and have a great sense of responsibility. Your talents are precision, neatness, diligence and humility. You are your own greatest critic, whereby you have been known to be too harsh. You could be even more successful if you did not always insist on keeping your light under a bushel. Try calling attention to your achievements once in a while.



You are a realist, even if it is only out of fear of disappointment or due to a lack of imagination, but you still manage to achieve the goals you set for yourself. You rationalize cool and responsibly without allowing any distortions due to unnecessary emotions. If problems arise you do not panic but work systematically on a solution. Probably you are too inhibited to talk about your private affairs at the office. Your colleagues respect you for that, but do not get to know you very well. If you could manage to open yourself up once in a while, the atmosphere at work would profit from it. 



Your boss has come to appreciate your loyalty. If you ever get the opportunity to take over the boss's chair, you should watch out that you do not place the same expectations on your employees as you do on yourself. A dose of praise at just the right time will motivate more effectively. You may work keeping the records in a laboratory, or go into data processing, the health field or scientific research.

    <Text>Recognition and approval are vital to your self-image. This will limit your choice of professions to those that are well accepted and offer chances to move up to a respected position. Your diplomatic way to climbing the corporate ladder enables you to avoid direct confrontation. You work on keeping the atmosphere in the office pleasant. Your success may actually be due to your good relations, because you know how to behave in every circle. It is no problem for you to adapt to a new boss and find ways to put yourself in a good light. Your friendly nature makes you popular at work and easy to integrate into teams. 



Your desire for success does not stop you from sharing the fruits of your labor with others. You are very fair and appreciate success only when you worked for it. Although you plan each step meticulously, carefully weighing all the options before committing yourself, determination will never cause you to neglect your private life because success is of no value to you if you cannot enjoy it.



You could find your place in the entertainment or fashion industry, in interior decorating, marriage brokerage, or in counseling. Traditional Astrology pegs you as a good diplomat and generally good at representing people.

    <Text>You know exactly what you want to achieve professionally and put everything you have got into your career. Anything getting in your way only serves as a challenge. The word defeat is not part of your vocabulary. You are determined and can drive yourself to extremely high performance. You do not care what people think of you because you are not working to please anybody else. Respect for your boss and colleagues has toughened you up to the point where you occasionally have to take criticism for being too aggressive. You may have a completely unfounded distrust of your colleagues. If this is the case, people would appreciate it if you loosened up a little. 



You have to fight many battles in the course of your career and will not win all of them. Defeat only makes you more conscious of your goal. You have no problem changing positions and adjusting to new situations as long as it gets you somewhere. You need constant challenge and will look for activities you care deeply about and work toward making a difference. You do not like to do things half way, your motto is "all or nothing". You should regularly reconsider the kind of compromises you make and ask yourself if some coercion was not involved or it could get to the point of destroying everything you have built.



A consultation of the positions of Mars and Pluto as well as their Aspects to the rest of the planets in your chart will tell how much these characteristics have shaped your personality.



You could go into psychology, scientific research, medicine or a technical field.

    <Text>Expecting your professional position to bring status, you pay careful attention to your reputation and would like others to follow your examples of both fairness and joviality. Pursuing a variety of interests will probably keep you from committing yourself to a profession until late in life. You prefer intellectual work but do not object to a physical counterbalance. With long-term and extensive career plans, you radiate confidence and optimism while fulfilling your ambitions. Your career is actually more of a calling because you use your influence to realize your ideals. Once you have gotten started, you will put everything into additional training to keep your high intellectual standards.



Your popularity as the boss comes from your policy of never asking others to do more than you do yourself and your efforts to keep the atmosphere at work pleasant. The well being of your employees is important to you, and they know that they can count on your loyalty. You always have a logical explanation of your standpoint and encourage participation in the decision making process. Pay attention that you do not start to defy yourself once, thanks to Jupiter's assistance, you got everything running to your satisfaction. You will not regret the addition of a healthy dose of self-criticism every now and then.



Consulting Jupiter's position and the Aspects between the other planets in your chart will give you a better idea of how strong the influence of these character traits are.



Professions in education, law or theology are your best prospects. Possibly work as a travel agent or a politician could interest you as well.

    <Text>Professionally you are after a stable income. You want to be thought of as steadfast and reliable. You will probably choose being trained in a traditional profession and avoid experimentation at all costs. Because your progress is direct and persistent and you do not let yourself be distracted, you will achieve your career goals in the end. You plan your career rationally (rather than by feeling) and find satisfaction in wielding power responsibly. Nothing is done carelessly. Even tedious routines are performed attentively. You work doggedly without expectations; confident that one day you will make it big. You are not hoping for a place in the spotlight with lots of recognition; you just want to be the one pulling the strings, keeping everything in your control, which is also manageable from backstage.



You judge your talents realistically. If you lose ground you look for a reason on your own grounds first. You are pragmatic and will not take excuses from your employees once you get to be the boss. Anyone who wants your respect will have to perform because words do not impress you. Do not let your career become drudgery, but try to socialize with your colleagues. Learn to enjoy the pleasant moments in the workday. 



You are well suited for work in insurance, construction, administration and bookkeeping.

    <Text>You strive to realize your humanitarian ideals at work. You are not one to plan ahead, but let yourself be easily distracted. This may prevent you from ever being promoted to a high position, which does not particularly bother you as long as your job offers some variation and excitement. You react to situations spontaneously, showing your unconventional side. More than anything else you want to do something that no one has ever done before. You go your own way and want to put your ideas into practice; whereby your only consideration is that you are doing something novel. A job requiring precision with a lot of routine tasks would bore you to no end. You also cannot bear to follow orders; a conservative boss would definitely be bad news. You probably are not disciplined enough to devote yourself to work which provides no challenge to your versatile intellect.



All of this should make starting your own business a viable alternative. You would be independent which would enable you to concentrate your energies on a specific task over a longer period of time. You could be successful in electronics, in the media or in the entertainment industry.



Your colleagues find you entertaining, unconventional and friendly. They value your solidarity. As soon as you have found your niche your creativity will rejuvenate the work environment.



Consult the position of Uranus and the Aspects between the other planets in your chart to determine the extent of the influence of these character traits.

    <Text>It is uncertain if you are steadfastly goal oriented and have enough energy to initiate great performances and to be successful. You do not plan ahead but follow your intuition. Stiff competition can depress you and cost you your composure. You are sensitive and want to keep the atmosphere in the office friendly. When conflicts do occur you passively wait for the outcome. This keeps you from calling attention to yourself and from making enemies. Promotions and status symbols do not mean much to you, when they do come along you may be the most surprised.



You like doing things that keep you around people and make use of your imagination and creativity. You would not be happy working with machines and cold calculations. Work in nursing would be ideal because helping others gives you a good feeling. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, you may become an artist or filmmaker. Psychology would be another alternative.



For an estimate of how these character traits influence you, take a closer look at Neptune's position and the Aspects between the other planets.

    <Text>We are pleased to see that you are showing an interest in your horoscope. We use a computer for this delicate task, but still we hope that we have been able to instill warmth and human feeling into our interpretations.



But what is ASTROLOGY??



Some people maintain that we humans are influenced by strange forces emanating from various planets. The popular press would have us believe that the inhabitants of planet Earth can be divided into twelve different types that they then fill with their shallow perceptions.



Astrology can only be as competent as the people who make use of it. Astrology as such is actually nothing more than a mathematical system, showing a person's planetary representation at the time of birth in a 360° circle.



To accomplish this we consider various factors. The first question to be answered is why these creatures involved in Astrology seem to be infatuated with the exact time of birth. It is really quite simple! We are interested in finding out which ascendant was chosen to experience Earthly life. The twelve houses symbolize the areas of life and the ascendant is the beginning of the FIRST HOUSE, the beginning of the chart.



What is it that awakens the chart's houses to life?



...The planets-each symbolizes a certain type of energy. Their positions within the houses determine into which areas of life their energy is channeled. In addition, the angular relationships of the planets to each other that are called aspects put Astrologers in the position to make statements about the manifestation of these diverse forms of energy in the life of an individual person.



CURIOUS?  You will have to be patient a little longer!



Before we get started on your horoscope, I would like to call your attention to a small problem. As you hold your interpretation in your hands, you may be startled to read that you are characterized differently in the various interpretation texts - Sun in Sagittarius: you are open, warm... followed by Moon in Capricorn: you appear cold and distanced... It is your job to piece them together, because everyone's character is made up of different qualities and you have learned more or less to live with these types of contradictions. Actually it is better to be open about contradictions in your personality, they allow for a change of pace once in a while and also provide opportunities for growth, although not necessarily without suffering. Try to understand of the fact that the computer does not know you and can not possibly present a complete picture.



For this reason it is very important that you do not get hung up on single words or examples in the texts and try to apply these strictly to your life. You should try to develop a feeling for the basic energies that are manifested in an aspect or a planet and keep in mind that they may appear in a somewhat different form in your life. Take the opportunity to discover and develop your own form of Astrology. Here you have finally found a field that is not governed by strict rules, but can be formed by your own individual sensitivity.



We wish you fruitful insights!!

    <TextId>The Part of Fortune - Your Personal Key for True Contentedness</TextId>
    <Text>Everyone asks themselves once in a while what they can do to be happy and finding an answer to this question is not as easy as it may seem, because many people have wrong impressions about their real needs. They might be convinced that they need something, are oriented on inappropriate role models or let themselves be influenced by other people's ideas while possibly they are already on the wrong path. Usually they are not aware of it until it is too late. If you know how to make someone really happy, usually you are prepared to make an effort or to make difficult decisions. This makes the Part of Fortune something like a personal code of ethics, which has to be remembered in every circumstance. It is one of the sensitive points and is derived from Arabic Astrology.



The Part of Fortune is calculated by subtracting the Sun position from the Ascendant position. We add the number of degrees of the moon to this result. A simple formula would look like the following:

Part of Fortune = Ascendant - Sun + Moon



The position of the Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant are not randomly used for calculating the Part of Fortune. It is based on the consideration that the energy of these three bodies are what characterize people and gives them their individual personalities:  The Sun as the symbol of identity and ambition, the Moon for its emotionality and its conscious and subconscious reactions, and finally the Ascendant as the visible personality, which expresses the energies of the Sun and the Moon. The position in the horoscope where Sun, Moon and Ascendant are most harmoniously working together is called the Part of Fortune. The energies of a sign and the affairs of the astrological house concerned will show you how to reach a state of true happiness.

    <Text>In order to experience long-lasting happiness, simply discover the world again and again as you follow your spirit of adventure, which does not necessarily have to involve travel. Everyday life should be exciting and filled with variety; you would not know what to do with peace and quiet anyway.  Challenges provide an opportunity to prove your strength and courage, and you look for them everywhere. Knowing that your personal successes were created on your own provides you with satisfaction at least for a short time; by then new challenges will have presented themselves, especially in the areas presented by the house where your Part of Fortune is found. The prerequisites of happiness are being active and doing something instead of making complicated plans, but most of all spontaneeity.



Your environment should not suffer from the way you concentrate on yourself when you work; although you may feel independent, you still need companionship. Additionally, getting to know people who are not afraid to say what is on their minds will provide you with new motivation.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in Taurus</TextId>
    <Text>In this world where everything is rapidly changing, you need something to hold onto to make you happy. You are also looking for lasting values, either of a material or spiritual nature. A relatively large need for security makes you always want to include the momentary circumstances of your life in your plans. Probably it will give you a deep sense of satisfaction to look back and see what you have accomplished in your lifetime, whether it is a business, a house or a loyal family, where mutual support is assured. This will form a foundation from which you can work, taking all the possible turns of events into consideration so that you will not be unpleasantly surprised. Probably you make a lot of effort to make sure that things develop according to your plan. It makes you feel good to make materials useful and to give things form and structure.



Try to avoid complicated relationships, unnatural behavior or a sophisticated lifestyle; you thrive on simplicity in everything and a natural environment. That applies especially to interpersonal relationships where it is important for you to know where you stand. Playing with fire does not appeal to you, it is more important to be able to place trust in certain people than to surround yourself with a large group of people who are fun to be with but who do not really know each other. Your partner should be someone you can lean on, who you can pamper with your sense of romance. This ties sexuality closely to love and intimacy.

    <Text>To you life means always adjusting to new circumstances and observing them out of varying perspectives. You need movement, intellectual challenges and to be surrounded by people who constantly provide you with new insights. This is why you need to communicate, keep yourself well informed and think about everything that is important to your existence and society. You are happy when you can communicate, discover interesting fields or analyze situations. Maybe you are not very adept at understanding the emotional side of people, but have no problem following their way of thinking.



It may sound paradox, but you like to be in the center of things without being so intimately involved that you cannot easily withdraw at any time. Your consciousness of reality tells you that it is not very useful to place a lot of importance on something you have no control over, and so you are often the observer who draws conclusions which make everything a little clearer without putting you in danger of being hurt. You feel intimacy not through emotional but through spiritual closeness, which is why your partner can only make you happy by creating an atmosphere in which interesting and practical conversations are possible.

    <Text>The energy of Cancer expresses itself most clearly in the wish to actively participate in decision processes that serve to improve the feeling of community.  This could be contributing an idea, organizing a project, taking care of a garden or even, which would certainly be the most intense, the birth of a child. These kinds of activities make you feel that you are part of the community and let you know where your place is, which is also something you need for your happiness.



Still you will have to overcome a barrier - your doubts about you doing the right thing with your life, whether you can trust certain people or if everything will turn out badly. Basically, it is all about overcoming fear in order to enjoy life with all its surprises. Then you will be able to help bring about changes and exercise a certain amount of influence, although you have to become aware of it first. Once you have overcome your fears and have faith, you will be pleased to devote yourself, especially to making your family happy. Knowing that you are needed and then creating a warm atmosphere where love, understanding and a feeling of belonging can grow will make you very happy.



If you have problems overcoming your doubts and showing the people closest to you how you really feel, it would make sense to think about your relationship to your parents and try to find the source of your insecurity. Also, you should always defend your private sphere, especially if your professional life is strenuous.

    <Text>Because you need the recognition of your community to be happy, you are willing to do a lot to make sure that no doubts about your integrity arise. Your high expectations of yourself due to your convictions about morality and respectability make you unwilling to compromise, although generally you can be very tolerant, as long as others leave room for your individuality. Always trying to give your best and to be a good example is an expression of your need to be respected by the community. This kind of self-motivation will help you to develop a strong personality during the course of your life. You will have the intellectual strength to overcome your subjective viewpoint and offer support to others, whereas you only seldom accept help from others. You need to feel proud of yourself and of the things you have accomplished; without knowing that you have overcome great hurdles and really "kicked ass", you can never be happy. You are not able to enjoy rewards that you have not earned honestly



It is important to you to have enough room to put all of your creative energy to use; you simply need space which you can organize in your own way, whether it is at work, in your free time or within the family. No matter how determined you seem to be, you need to know where you stand. Because respect is a prerequisite for happiness you are always trying to get feedback from others.

    <Text>Happiness depends on knowing that you are in control of everything you do and of your entire life. Your perception of existence is primarily oriented to tangible things which can be explained, you are not interested in mysteries. You want to deal with situations with clear facts, which is why you are happy to "clean up" in any sense of the word. People whose motivations you cannot identify or who lead unstable lives are not your type, unless they are trying to get their lives back on the right track. In cases like these you should keep your distance and not make the mistake of confusing other people's needs with your own.



It is easy for you to stay in the here and now. You have no fear of reality as long as you can recognize your options. Every victory of reason makes you happy because you will always work to stay on top of things and find reasonable pragmatic solutions.

    <Text>It makes you happy to work on your relationships until you feel that you are being well taken care of. This allows you to devote your entire potential to your popularity without having to force yourself to do so. Mostly you want to avoid feeling alone and do everything you can to be accepted by your community.  You back off from your position instead of trying to convince the majority to see things your way, you work to maintain harmony in your surroundings and try to unravel complicated situations. Shared experiences, especially with your partner, are very important to you, but when you are alone you do not feel like doing much. 



You always want to feel welcome everywhere you go and avoid imposing yourself under any circumstances. It is not necessary to fight or to strain yourself in order to be proud of your successes; you prefer things to stay tranquil and uneventful. It is enough for you to say that you could achieve anything you set your mind to. Possibly you participate in other people's experiences so intensively that you do not have to do much on your own and lead a more peaceful life this way, which is fine with you.

    <Text>Probably you are not searching as much for happiness as to find a confirmation that your perception of life, seeing everything as transient, is correct. In your search for challenges and extreme experiences in order to get to know yourself, you outdo even the most daring. Each time you test your limits and are able to push them back still further fills you with joy. On a physical level, sexuality plays a large role in your life.  You thoroughly enjoy the purest life energy that lets people know where they came from, which, of course, is nature, although you do not neglect the other side of being human and are always in search of truth and spirituality. The meaning of existence, the essence of evolution and human development interest you in such a way that you like to track things down and get behind mysteries.



Being conscious of transience and the inevitability of death could even have a calming effect on you and give you courage to test how far your fighting instinct and your will power will take you. Basically, you want to use your entire potential and experience life as intensely as possible.

    <Text>Probably you are naturally content without being aware of its value. It is part of your personality to believe in the future and in the good in people and this attitude will be rewarded. Positive thinking will give you strength to take life easy without becoming superficial. Feeling unstrained may be one prerequisite for your happiness.  Freedom is something precious that you could never give up. When you obligate yourself then it is voluntary and with consciousness. 



There is a lot of natural self-confidence in you and it is enough for you to enjoy life, discovering some meaning beyond this is not a priority for you. Telling the truth and acting on it, being authentic is more important to you; you would not be able to live with yourself if you did otherwise. Another quality that you appreciate is your spontaneity. Anyone who tries to keep you from going on adventures or letting your enthusiasm show will not be your friend for very long. Otherwise, you do your best to get along with everyone, which contributes to your popularity as well as your general happiness.

    <Text>For you happiness means the satisfaction of knowing that you have accomplished something in your life and have put your talents to effective use. Seeing how your plans are realized and take shape, how things move into the right place and proceed as they should makes you happy. Your goal is to apply what you have learned usefully and to draw as much as possible out of your experiences. In your surroundings things should be determined by reason, probably because you sense instinctively that becoming too emotional could be dangerous and might interfere with your progress.



A desire to contribute your part and be a recognized member of society, maybe even social climbing, explains why you prefer to rely on your own accomplishments; probably you never want to be dependent on accepting assistance because you could not reconcile that with your image. Aging holds no fear for you because you associate it with maturity, which can only be useful to your plans. On the other hand, you see youth as more of a handicap, of not being taken seriously by society.

    <Text>The prerequisite for your happiness is having enough freedom to stand behind your ideals without making compromises. Friendship is more important to you than a romantic relationship where each places expectations on the other. What you need is room to experiment, the company of people with similar convictions and critical attitude toward social norms. Recognizing that you are living as an individual in a group and that potential can be magnified are important experiences that will motivate you to fight for equality and against prejudices of every kind.



Belief in the future is something you have in common with those whose Part of Fortune is in Sagittarius, because you believe that humanity will find solutions to the present problems. Basically you have a lot of understanding for the weaknesses of our species, so that you seldom react furiously but usually have an explanation at hand. You are by no means indifferent to development, still you need a certain emotional distance to things, because Aquarius is an air sign and therefore has an intellectual emphasis. Do not let yourself be pressured into acting hypocritically, which in the end will only stand in the way of true harmony.  You need your freedom, which you are also willing to grant others.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in Pisces</TextId>
    <Text>Pisces is the most spiritual sign of the Zodiac and represents universal love and sympathy. This is why your happiness depends on not placing more emphasis on yourself than on each person around you. An exaggerated or exclusive occupation with the factual reality of every day life could distract you from making use of your limitless imagination and the recognition of your true needs, namely overcoming your own ego and conforming to the natural flow of life. The victories you have fought for will not make you happy, although knowing that you can attain detachment and not be trapped in earthly struggles will. Happiness will come when you succeed in accepting life with all of its joys and sorrows, without long-term rigid plans which create the illusion of power and are not likely to work out anyway, leaving you feeling dissatisfied.



You should work on your inner stability and try to do more for others than for yourself. Work on getting to the root of your emotions and see yourself in relation to the whole world. Your potential for establishing a deep feeling of being connected to every living thing will never leave you feeling lonely and will make you happy.

    <Text>Having this constellation in your chart you will find fulfillment by going your own way and finding the courage to free yourself from other people's opinions and society's moralistic standards. Success will come from relying on yourself acting according to your personal way of seeing things, which may be out of the ordinary. In the course of your life you will make your mark on society while remaining true to yourself in spite of any controversy which may arise around you. Additionally, you want to be appreciated for your uniqueness; when someone thinks they can go over your head or insist on comparing you with normal citizens, that is something you cannot deal with and feel challenged to prove the opposite. Then at the very least you take the liberty of doing and saying what you really think at the time, just to make sure that there is something going on. Probably you are not well known for being considerate, and at times it may be difficult to convince you that there are factors other than your interests that must also be considered. Still, subjectivity and your way of concentrating on yourself should give you the necessary drive to work on projects you find interesting. You could become the leader of a new movement, which will most likely be something unusual.



It often does not make any difference to you if you are isolated by your actions or if others just do not understand you. It would make you unhappy if something would keep you away from following your instincts or placing restrictions on the essence of your being and your lifestyle. It would be more to your liking if you could, just once, take off with an idea without long contemplation and tedious planning. It would even be a distraction for you if you were to get involved with the community or notice other people's reactions. On the other hand you certainly do not want to risk getting a reputation for being too strange or too incompetent to stand up and take command.



With the Part of Fortune in the first house, you are faced with the challenge of finding the "golden path" in the middle between striving for individuality and independence and living within the community. First and foremost, you should remember not to interfere in areas where you would not accept interference from others. It will cause problems if you were to try to help people who are ready to start some project only to have them lose interest shortly thereafter. Do not believe that your lifestyle is appropriate for everyone, most people need the support of their community and do not find it difficult to adapt to expectations from others.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Second House</TextId>
    <Text>You will be happy if, during the course of your life, you come to recognize which values are important to you and are not afraid to admit having a need to feel secure. A feeling of fulfillment will come from working to build something, working toward the same goal over a long period of time and having something to rely on. In conjunction with your preference to remain a part of the material world, you enjoy working on concrete topics. Seeing things progress piece by piece is satisfying. Also it is extremely important for you to remain financially independent, earning your own income.



It is especially satisfying to discover that you can manage your own finances and take responsibility for your decisions. In this respect, money plays a large role; it has the function of providing you with the things that you consider useful to have. If it would be your intention to earn money to spend on useless prestige objects, this would divert you from your path and bar you from success. Acquiring wealth may not be seen as an end in itself; it is more a foundation for building a life.



Probably you are capable of consequently following the goals you set, which makes it necessary to consider whether they fit your character. Do not make the mistake of taking on other people's values. It is more important to develop tolerance and not to concern yourself with what other people think is important. If you are financially well situated and feel guilty about what you have earned, then it would all be a waste. Do not resist that you may have to change on occasion fearing this would interfere with your development; it is only helpful to detach yourself from things that you no longer value.

    <Text>Communication, getting involved in intellectual debates in your environment and learning about new fields of study, are the things that make you happy. Trying to understand others will help you to grow and also come to a better understanding of yourself. Sometimes you have the feeling of being able to live many different lives because you make an effort to put yourself in other people's situations and try to understand how they think.



It is important to you to receive answers to all the questions you have and to frequently make interesting observations. Probably there is nothing better for you than to see that you have learned something. This means that intellectual wealth is more important to you than material possessions. Developing new methods or analyzing a complicated procedure is also very satisfying; it is your intention to make yourself useful and to work on inventing solutions to problems or making improvements (such as on procedures or on communication). Usually you prefer to rely on logic and reason because they can help to create clarity, in human relations as well as in other areas. With all the various sides to your personality, contact with many people is essential.



Most of all, you enjoy working on every day things which will, during the course of your life, raise your consciousness and help you to attain an understanding of philosophical principles without relying on an education in the classical sense. Try to get as much intellectual stimulation as you can; without it you will never recognize your potential.

    <Text>The most basic human need is to feel that we make a difference, which is why people feel good when they are doing everything they can to contribute to the well being of people they feel close to or care for animals or even plants. It is also satisfying to observe the development of relationships, to see a child growing and watch trust evolve. With an attitude toward life so strongly oriented on giving, it is sometimes difficult for you to take; at the very least you want to show your appreciation immediately. Probably you have an emotional conscience. Recognition of the responsibility you take on for the well being of others comes very naturally from within you and determines much of your behavior. Seen this way, once you have found your fortune you will not take anything at the cost of others.



In the near future you may not have an easy time finding your way in the world, where social order does not always allow for the expression of deep emotions; also disappointments may arise when your good nature is abused or if you are deprived of recognition. That does not necessarily have to change your broad-minded attitude or prevent you from doing what you want to do. Naturally, you should set goals for yourself, but choose goals that you can relate to spiritually. If you act contrary to your feelings, your plans will never be realized. Try to establish closeness with all of your endeavors such that it leads to a personal identification. Soon you will recognize that this is what you need to be happy.



Family plays a very important role for you, especially your mother. Probably it is not easy for you to judge the situation objectively, but the feeling of belonging to your family can give you the kind of security other people search for their whole lives. This can be summarized by saying that you find fulfillment in the opportunity to express your feelings without having to abide by strict rules. Take care that you stay in contact with nature because you value your relationship to nature highly.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Fifth House</TextId>
    <Text>The fifth house is an area in which people experience their creativity and actively create. Because you find your Part of Fortune there, you will find fulfillment in your life only if you are given every opportunity to create according to your own will. This refers not necessarily to the most difficult (physical) construction work; you rather need a way to express yourself to bring your personality across, whereby the arts are especially appropriate. Your work will usually contain a playful element, although you make an effort to at least appear to take your work seriously and have no problems with responsibility or organizing extensively. Although it is no fun if you are not able to use the contacts you make to polish your self-image and bask in appreciation, certainly you do not want to have anything to do with people you feel do not respect you.



The tendency to constantly wander back and forth between the two poles, society and self-centeredness, is simple to explain - you are not able to recognize which of your qualities are special until you enter into society with others, and a positive self-image is very important to you.  Community is necessary to find out how much personality you have. Probably that will motivate you to add your own personal coloring to everything you do and see it as an expression of your creativity. Another possibility for self-expression is a good flirt, which you will have nothing against because your playfulness can be expressed more clearly in a harmless game of romance. Children are also associated with the fifth house, this means that you will be able to contribute to their happiness. You can have a lot of fun rediscovering your competitive nature and take part in small competitions with no inhibitions. You may get more excited than the kids about winning a game of pin the tail on the donkey.



Also it is very important for you to defend your vast imagination and not restrict yourself in this respect. The diversity of your thoughts will create your own little world where you make the rules and can order everything the way you want it.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Sixth House</TextId>
    <Text>Fulfillment will come from making yourself useful and concentrating on your work. Luxury, comfort and success or fame will not be important; you probably want to be sure to make effective use of your time and contribute your talents to well planned projects. Probably you work pragmatically and avoid unnecessary complications. An emphasis is placed on concrete goals, reliable workers and a practical orientation, whereby you are naturally inclined to work thoroughly, keeping an eye on the details.



Taking on menial work and following orders does not bother you, if it is necessary. It is important to be sure that you know how your role fits into the larger framework of things and to be able to contribute your part. Probably you will not have close friendships with people who like to dream and are not clear about what they want out of life; you will also have little understanding for difficult emotional problems, complicated mood swings or theories which tend to get out of hand.  You are generally willing to help and are happy to offer practical assistance which brings visible results. Especially in the areas of health and nutrition you can serve as a good example of how people should treat their bodies.



Most important is your consciousness, which can serve to guide your life by providing well thought out decisions. Because you need as much control over your fate as possible, you will not be able to endure being vulnerable, leaving your future dependent on unforeseeable factors. It would be best to find a job where you can make use of your methodical thoroughness and avoid getting entangled in complicated relationships where you cannot be sure if others value you or not. If you can, lead a simple and natural life and live freely, even if others find you a little strange. The biggest mistake would be to be inactive, sitting with your hands in your lap.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Seventh House</TextId>
    <Text>To find your fortune, look for a community where you can actively participate and where you feel comfortable enough to show your best side and make other people aware of their positive qualities. Probably you are constantly in search of companionship and are inclined to emphasize bonding factors over those that divide. Maybe you frequently catch yourself thinking more about other people's well-being than your own; success at the cost of your colleagues it not something you can enjoy. Maybe you ask yourself what actually makes up your identity, because you do not want to be isolated, you even find out what other people think before making a decision. But do not worry about it; work on finding yourself by letting your relationships get deeper. Do not insist on proving your individuality.



All of this should be enough to convince you to look for a job where you come into contact with people and which gives you the opportunity to incorporate service. You care about everyone you know, whether you know them privately or from work. Personal relationships with your colleagues will develop because rigid professionalism and strict rules are not your style. In spite of high expectations of respectable behavior, you are usually tolerant of the mistakes of others and tend to place no one but yourself under pressure.



As already indicated, you usually take on the opinions of people who are important to you, which is why it is not always easy to say what you really want. Sometimes you feel that certain people around you determine your life more than you will ever be able to. Once you have recognized this and are still content with the situation, the problem will have disappeared on its own. Feel fortunate that you are able to contribute to other people's happiness that in turn makes you feel happy.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Eighth House</TextId>
    <Text>As opposed to those who have their Part of Fortune in the seventh house and find happiness through giving, you will be able to take joyfully, which is actually a quality that is not so common. You are able to appreciate the true value of what is given to you, without feeling guilty about it and becoming obsessed with finding a way to repay it. Frequently you are occupied with thoughts on how to put the resources at your disposal to the best use. We can say that it makes you happy to make good use of the energies or materials that you acquire through professional contacts or your partner. This provides motivation to keep up the relationships that are most important to you, whereby you make an effort to notice what various people close to you value in order to behave likewise.



Possibly it will not be easy for you to restrain yourself and accept that your moral standards are not the only ones. In the course of your life, you will experience that people's hopes and dreams are similar, regardless of whether they are material or spiritual values. The only difficulty is recognizing true values, as opposed to useless possessions that eventually take possession of their owner. Once you can differentiate between the two, you will not hesitate to draw the consequences and get rid of that which is worthless, because the eighth house and its attached sign, Scorpio, represent transformation.



In the end it will make you happy to discover for yourself that you are capable of letting go and developing yourself further, of coming to terms with life's cycles and sensing a deep connection to life on this planet.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Ninth House</TextId>
    <Text>You will experience your happiness when you feel certain that you have come a few steps closer to the truth. In many respects you are a seeker who asks basic questions and is striving to find the meaning of existence. You want to develop yourself, focus your consciousness and gain an understanding of the concepts embodied in the institutions of our civilization. What you are striving for is wisdom both in thought and in action; although that sounds very determined you should not let it intimidate you. Naturally you are conscious of your imperfections, but that should not keep you from drawing the power you need for your search.



It makes you happy to connect with people through personal conversation that goes beyond every day topics. The ability to teach, which is ascribed to the sign Sagittarius as well as to the ninth house, will help you make yourself understood and spread your ideas, as people will be interested in your way of thinking. Maybe you will be able to develop your own ideas about a more humane society and convince others to try to live more in harmony with the cosmic order. Do not forget that tolerance is a prerequisite for the privilege of being allowed to observe how the thoughts which you cast out take root in the minds of other people and blossom.



It may be difficult for you, while you are in a secular environment, to keep an eye on the little everyday problems. Also you have to watch out that you do not develop a tendency to overintellectualize because truths do not just come from thought and when your heart does not contribute its part, you may lose touch with the joy you used to feel. Maybe you will discover that your search leads to yourself and that there is something divine in every being.

    <Text>Happiness will come when you find the strength to develop personal integrity to remain true to your principles. It is truly an art to maintain a certain position and at the same time remain flexible without expecting others to have the same attitude. Also reducing everything to black and white or right and wrong is a grave mistake because life's structures are always more complicated. Your position in society, which is so important to you, will not be established until you take on the responsibility that goes along with it and organize your environment appropriately. This is why you will have to take on obligations that will not be easy to fulfill. In the end it will deeply satisfy you to be able to observe how structures develop and you receive the recognition you deserve. An unshakable self-image will be the result.



In time your decisions will be well thought out, and your strategies realistic such that you will begin to climb upwards. Also the ability to use social relationships to your advantage will help you to earn recognition. This will allow you to use your influence later to help colleagues out with useful advice. A deep sense of respect for every individual you meet will characterize you as fair and honest, which indicates that you accept other people's limits. At least you should try to develop these qualities if you want to enjoy life, because you probably will not be able to forgive yourself if you have an unpleasant manner. Also, you are big enough not to demand more than you can give yourself.



Because your well being is dependent on being sure that you are acting according to your moral convictions, your ethics will not allow you to make use of any advantages that you have not come about honestly. Still, if you let yourself be misled, it will get in the way of your own happiness because you will secretly punish yourself with guilt. For this reason it will be necessary for you to be sure about what you find to be legitimate. Just do not make the mistake of undergoing constant self-examination and destroying all spontaneity.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Eleventh House</TextId>
    <Text>Nothing makes you as happy as knowing that you are free to decide and that you have every opportunity. Only from this foundation are you capable of following a group instinct and making friends. Nothing will come from pressure but a defiant attitude. It may seem paradox, but you will recognize that the freer you feel, the more willing you will be to take on responsibility and then also to put effort into fulfilling it.



You need to have people around with whom you feel spiritually connected and who inspire you to develop universal ideas. Within a group you demonstrate your ability to aim your thoughts on the future and you air your ideas about the development of humanity. Probably people consider you witty or simply unusual because you surround yourself with unconventional personalities and enjoy exchanging opinions. It is a part of your personality to spread your ideas and to question everything you meet up with. Probably you will have enough energy to put your ideas into practice or at least to take the first step, as long as you surround yourself with people who are able to establish a community based on common convictions and you can work together toward common goals. Your drive to be creative in the group is so great that you find every activity and every area interesting.



The eleventh house is the opposite of the fifth house, where the will to present yourself has an emotional basis. Here your will has a stronger intellectual emphasis. A relationship may be impersonal in some respect and might be based more on intellectual closeness than on emotions. Nevertheless, you can be very loyal and conscientiously stand by your friends. Deepening friendships that challenge you intellectually and bring you to reflect will make you happy.

    <TextId>Your Part of Fortune in the Twelfth House</TextId>
    <Text>You will be happy as soon as you have developed the maturity to distance yourself from the stress of every day life, and find enough peace to look inside yourself. The twelfth house is the house of detachment, so that material success, money or recognition will not fulfill your Part of Fortune. You will not be happy until you have recognized that you do not need any of that. Maybe the path to this insight will not be easy, but you will be rewarded in the end by finding happiness within you; you alone are the key. With this, you will feel connected to every living thing and feel a kind of universal love that will bring you great joy. By making contact to your innermost being you could reach a higher level of consciousness.



To get there, you should free yourself from primary needs and concentrate on your spiritual well being. Do not let yourself be distracted from your drive for success or even unconscious reactions to everyday events. Try to avoid judging people, which will only serve to get you involved because you identify with the circumstances. It is your challenge to become independent and use this as a basis to contact people who are completely different from you. This position allows you to understand the world with your heart.  As with people who have their Part of Fortune in the ninth house you, are concerned with wisdom and truth, but your intellect is not involved as much as your soul is. By recognizing yourself and your human traits, you also find out about the meaning of your existence. Intuitive understanding will help more than hours of intellectual contemplation.
