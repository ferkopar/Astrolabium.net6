1;RADIX_0000000000000004;A nap;"The Sun is referred to as the star at the center of our solar system. It is a sphere, around which the Earth and the other planets rotate in an elliptical orbit, which causes the distance between the two to vary. The Sun is enormous in relation to the planets, approximately 700 times larger than all the planets put together. Although from the Earth, the Sun seems to cross above us symmetrically from East to West every day, it only appears to be so. Following the Vernal Equinox the Sun moves to the North until the 21st of June (in the Northern Hemisphere the day with the shortest night) when it reaches its climax in Cancer. It changes directions turning south continuing past the autumnal equinox until reaching its turning point in Capricorn on the 22nd of December, in the northern hemisphere the day with the longest night.



The Sun was naturally the first and most important celestial body to be observed by man and therefore plays an import role in mythology. The Sun is personified by Apollo (in Greek mythology) and by Hellos (in Roman mythology). This god brought life energy, enlightenment and healing. In Astrology the position of the Sun describes our personalities. People who are not yet well acquainted with Astrology refer to themselves as Pisces if the Sun was in the sign Pisces at the time of their birth. Naturally, the Sun is a very important part of the interpretation but it remains merely one factor among many. A well-placed Sun enables us to radiate joy, confidence and strength as well as fight off disease. The Sun corresponds to the sign Leo, which has the same attributes."
2;RADIX_0000000000000001;Your Sun in Aries;"The zodiac begins with Aries, a fire sign, ruled by Mars. Here, original life impulses and emerging energies are found. Aries represents the beginning of development and does not concern itself with the past. The Aries prefers to move forward without looking back. An Aries personality has enormous potential for energy and motivation. People born under this cardinal sign, are constantly on the lookout for new directions in which they can pioneer. The disadvantage is a lack of endurance and interest to stay with a task for an extended period of time.



If you could learn to concentrate your energy potential to accomplish a specific goal, you would find it easier to be successful. Instead of taking the time to think and plan you want to act on impulse. Consider the needs of others more carefully if you want to avoid ending up alone at the top because nobody was able to keep up with you. You tend to overlook important details and then later wonder what went wrong. This should motivate you to plan your actions thoroughly or include others in the planning. Do not be too quick to discount the advice of others; listen to well-intended suggestions, and you will find that it can be to your advantage.



You are challenged by your own ambition. Because your leadership qualities are undisputed, you receive recognition that is essential for you. 

If you are able to develop more sensitivity and treat others with diplomacy, nothing will stand in the way of your success, because the really positive aspect of Aries is that they never give up."
3;RADIX_0000000000016385;Your Sun in Taurus;"Determination and ambition characterize Taurus, an earth sign. Taureans are challenged not to be seduced by the material comforts of life; they also know to enjoy their well-earned successes.



Because Taurus is ruled by Venus, you have a lively interest in the pleasant side of life. You are a sensual person and materially oriented, preferring to see tangible results. Do not make the mistake of defining yourself by your possessions.



You require security and stability in your life and like to work for your retirement. You do not want to be bothered with financial worries and are also prepared to work for financial stability. You do not find it difficult to work for a long time on a task, but it should be something sensible. You like gardening and would even enjoy building a house. You spend money responsibly. Earning interest makes you very happy. When provoked, you can forget about comfort and raise hell, as Taureans are known to do. But it takes a while to reach that point.



In romantic relationships you tend to be jealous and possessive. On the other hand, no other sign of the Zodiac can develop the loyalty of a Taurus. It is important for you to learn that you cannot own people, but that they have willingly decided to share a part of their life with you."
4;RADIX_0000000000032769;Your Sun in Gemini;"The sign Gemini is ruled by the planet Mercury and is considered an Air Sign. You are known for your ability to communicate and are easy going. Contact to others is essential to you. You love a good conversation and take care to express yourself precisely. You also keep yourself informed of daily events. The media branch fascinates you; you may find a future career in it. Since Gemini is an Air Sign you find it easy to learn about any field. Take the time to withdraw to a quiet place; relaxation and reflection does you a lot of good. If you allow yourself the luxury more often you will find that you have more energy. Be careful not to let yourself get caught up in disputes which leave you exhausted and upset your inner balance. Learn to differentiate between useful information and activities from those that are unimportant; this will help you avoid overloading yourself. You may find that putting your creative energies into writing may help you to find the necessary composure to organize your thoughts.



You are creative and are always interested in the latest fad. If you were not able to get the education you wanted in your youth, you will try to compensate for this deficit for the rest of your life.



If you do not have enough change in your life, you may become moody and may even take your resentment out on the people around you. To avoid this, be sure to keep your mind alert and stimulated. Take time to think about your role in this universe and do not always react to criticism from your friends by being insulted because that will not help you."
5;RADIX_0000000000049153;Your Sun in Cancer;"Cancer is a water sign that causes people to be sensitive and want to share their feelings with others. It is also a feminine sign, and is associated with the Moon, standing for the female potential in a person. Your emotions are determined by the phases of the Moon. Emotional stability will never be one of your strengths, which can drive people around you crazy. A satisfying home life gives you security; this is why you have all the necessary qualities to create it. Sensitivity is one of your strengths, but also one of your weaknesses, whereby you are especially hurt when you are laughed at.



You prefer to hide your soft nucleus under a thick shell. You are afraid to admit your vulnerability. You should learn to accept your mistakes and weaknesses and open yourself up to others. This will allow you to live up to your potential. You are capable of giving affection and warmth, so much so that it is a shame not to put these qualities to use. You need others and should overcome your fear of rejection.



You have a good imagination, but a confused mind. You are not ambitious enough to put your talents to use. Overcome your inhibitions about telling people what you really think, sometimes it takes a long time for you to express yourself openly and directly. Try to assert yourself with resolute and clear effort. This will be good for your self-confidence."
6;RADIX_0000000000065537;Your Sun in Leo;"The fire sign, Leo, is ruled by the Sun, or the great light, as medieval Astrologers phrased it. The element of fire means the recognition and fulfillment of future possibilities. The Sun gives us the energy we need for our daily activities. It is the center of all life and represents the vitality in us.



Leos are generous people who sometimes have a stately emotional life. Leos are generously endowed with love, gratefulness and charm that they like to give to others. Leos live by their convictions and invest all their energy in their personalities. People born under the sign Leo find the influence of Sun symbolism as a challenge to become radiant. This abundance of positive qualities does not save Leos from having to learn to find themselves and their own energy independently of others. In other words, the Leos' most important task is to find himself.



You like to be in the limelight of a privileged position. You enjoy leaving a lasting impression on people. Your guardian angel helps you, appearing when you most need her. Practically, this means that your problems seem to vanish just when you start feeling trapped by them. 



For a Leo, nothing is more important than the own inner world. You find it difficult to overcome yourself and accept that others see things differently. You sometimes have trouble recognizing the needs of those around you. Leo, in contrast to Libra, Cancer and Pisces, is not a sign of relationships.



You hate routines and become impatient when things do not progress at your speed. You are quick to be insulted by criticism and often cannot understand what others find wrong with you. You are convinced of yourself and of your abilities and crave for recognition. You cannot be overlooked because you inspire awe. As soon as you have received your necessary allotment of admiration, you can be generous and open-heartedly share your riches with others. You remind people of a king from a fairy tale who is kind, whenever he is not fighting off an evil enemy or sees his kingdom threatened. When it is necessary you should appear simple and humble and make use of your creative potential."
7;RADIX_0000000000081921;Your Sun in Virgo;"People born under the Earth Sign Virgo tend to place their professional careers first. Virgo is the most realistic sign, which is ruled by the planet Mercury and is constantly in search of knowledge, which can immediately be put into practice. Virgos can differentiate precisely; a simple yes or no is never enough.



Your love of detail allows you to work with care and precision. Disorder and sloppiness only serve to challenge you to straighten up your surroundings. You like your work, enjoy fulfilling obligations and therefore must watch out not to let yourself be used or exploited. You have often placed too much importance on work and have missed the pleasant side of life.



You analyze your surroundings rigorously and are capable of loosing yourself in details to the point where you are not able to put the pieces together to make a whole. Do not forget the importance of recognizing the essentials in life. Do not let yourself get caught up in banalities.



Practice being tolerant and be aware of the danger of taking your views too seriously. You are capable of realizing your visions but have to learn to accept that some people have other ways of doing things. 



The sign Virgo represents health. Do not let your many worries exhaust you, this could prove harmful to your health. Basically, worrying is pointless because you will never change the course of events by worrying about them. 



The ties between the sign Virgo and the Earth explain why you value material riches and the comfort they bring. You look for quality when you shop and despise cheap mass-produced items.



Even if you are not the most romantic person and pride yourself on your autonomous, single lifestyle, you are hiding a great longing for security. You may want to reconsider your exaggerated demands on a partner.



Women, born under the sign Virgo, dominate relationships and organize the daily routines in the family. You have no reason to feel guilty about it; it just shows that you are prepared to accept responsibility."
8;RADIX_0000000000098305;Your Sun in Libra;"Libra, being a Cardinal and an Air Sign, allows you to direct your energies towards goals and initiate new situations. You prefer to plan your activities with others because you do not like being alone. The planet Venus, which rules over Libra, radiates pleasant qualities in search of harmony. You are charming and know how to dress tastefully. You want to be recognized, but are not willing to sacrifice your principles for it. It is more important to be able to smile at your reflection in the mirror.



You like to revel in thoughts of romance and fantasize about melting together with an ideal partner. You fear conflict, jealousy and hate because they contradict your aesthetic ideal of truth. This does not keep you from persevering and effectively organizing your daily activities. Be careful not to let your desire for perfection cause you to overload yourself.



Your polished manners and weakness for the finer art of living enable you to take center stage. With your friendly, courteous nature you will do well in a profession working with people.



Libra is an air sign. This is why you use reason to create visions of the best possible human society. You do everything to find your ideal, professionally and in relationships. Your sense of diplomacy and justice should make you popular and allow you to count on the help of your friends."
9;RADIX_0000000000114689;Your Sun in Scorpio;"Scorpio is a fixed water sign ruled by the planets Pluto and Mars. This constellation creates a lot of energy, which may be released suddenly. Scorpios, due to their water quality, are usually motivated by emotion, making them difficult to predict.



You do not take things lightly, but try to get to the root of the matter. Lies and half-truths make you angry, but when your own success is threatened, you are not immune to dishonesty. It is not easy to break your will. Like no other Sign of the Zodiac, Scorpios display a certain strength of regeneration and transformation, which allows you to get through the worst crises unscathed. You like using challenges to test your limits. It is essential for you to act out of the right motives, because you are capable of causing havoc when your vision is clouded by your own egotistical ambitions. You can use your abilities as you choose, either to manipulate and humiliate or to build up and support others. You have trouble letting go of defeats.



Sexuality and passion play a large role in your life. You strive to unite with the universe and can probably achieve this best erotically. Restrain your jealousy and do not turn sexuality into a stupid power struggle if you intend to enjoy it and tap its energy. Your understanding of the cycles of eternal life overrides your fear of death."
10;RADIX_0000000000131073;Your Sun in Sagittarius;"Sagittarius is a mutable fire sign always searching for new experiences. It requires intellectual freedom and does not let itself be constrained by exterior conditions or by pensive reservations. The planet Jupiter, with its prominent qualities, charity and magnitude rules Sagittarius. It is always standing by as a guardian angel and brings needed luck, even when you think that it is too late.



You are open to other people and go through life with optimism. Your search for truth leads you to wonder about the meaning of life and constantly strive for higher knowledge. You find ethical and philosophical topics interesting and like to share your wisdom with others. Social responsibility is a high priority. You must take care not to indiscriminately measure others by your standards; you may be lacking the necessary sensitivity to make a fair judgment. With sarcasm you may unintentionally hurt those around you. You should not wonder if others find your behavior arrogant and accuse you of being dogmatic and you find yourself isolated. In these moments, exercise tolerance and try to put yourself in the position of the other.



Your steadfast principles may make others appear conservative, which is only partially true, because you hold your own standards as the highest authority. People born under the sign Sagittarius are convinced that life is an adventure, a journey and a search for hidden treasure.



Your intuition allows you to understand the future significance of actions and makes you aware that everything we see and experience on a daily basis is the result of mankind's history.



Sagittarius is the most adventurous sign of the zodiac. This can be traced back to the planet Jupiter, which likes to remain at a distance, the farther the better. You are very open to foreign cultures and will probably develop your own personal view of the world during your lifetime."
11;RADIX_0000000000147457;Your Sun in Capricorn;"The sign Capricorn is ruled by the planet Saturn, giving you a more serious character. You take great care in fulfilling your responsibilities. You do not shy away from taking on responsibility for yourself or for others and are willing to work hard for it. You define your goals clearly. Your determination causes you to make realistic plans. Because Capricorn is an Earth sign, you will devote your life to working conscientiously towards fulfilling your obligations. This may include working in a larger framework, because you are not afraid of openly addressing the public. You can organize effectively and can be an example when it comes to endurance and reliability. If you become interested in politics and decide to actively participate, you will find that you have all the energy you will need. If you pursue a career to gain prestige you will be successful because you are truly a wonder of self-discipline. You will find your connections and contacts useful.



You concentrate on essentials and do not allow yourself to be distracted. It is not difficult for you to respect law and order, because you tend to follow the prescribed form. Do not become too fascinated with the social position or status symbols of others, it seldom leads to real friendships. Do not put yourself under pressure to succeed. Enjoy time with your loved ones, it will do you good. You will probably find growing old pleasant and become more relaxed than you were in your youth."
12;RADIX_0000000000163841;Your Sun in Aquarius;"People born under the sign of Aquarius see themselves as a rejuvenating force, breaking down outdated societal structures and preparing the way for a better, liberated life in a humane society.



Friendship and solidarity are of great importance for you. This can be traced back to the planet Uranus, which rules the sign Aquarius. Your friends know that they can depend on you because Uranus fosters philanthropy and humanitarian ideals.



You demonstrate originality and are proud to be different from all the others. You have thousands of fantastic ideas and a sense for unconventional problem solving. However, you should not try to evade taking action yourself and let others work to realize your plans. Basically, you are aware of your responsibility and are a kind person. If you are sometimes considered a bit of a crackpot and not taken seriously, remember that not everyone can paint the future as brightly as you do and not everyone is prepared to take unconventional steps toward realizing their goals. You have high ideals and love truth above all else. Take care not to become impatient and get a reputation for being an upstart, constantly criticizing destructively without offering a better alternative.



You will never complain about a lack of company, because you need lots of contact and feel most comfortable in a group. You share your ideas and reflect on any topic that is currently being discussed. You are open for anything new and are spirited, even if sudden, unexpected changes upset you. You pay also special attention to practicing the equality of the sexes in everyday life."
13;RADIX_0000000000180225;Your Sun in Pisces;"Due to your sensitive nature you are able to pick up on mood changes in your surroundings. Sometimes it is hard to tell if it is a blessing or a curse because your extraordinary perception can cause internal confusion. You are like a sponge, taking in everything indiscriminately, later wondering which are your own emotions and opinions. You often complain about hard reality. Your beautiful ""dream world"" will not provide a permanent solution; you are going to have to learn to get along with the way things are. You should withdraw more often and try to relax with good literature.



Pisces, being the last of the twelve Sun signs, takes on something from each one. You are swimming in the great ocean of the diversity of signs. This may not always be easy. You often have trouble making a decision because Neptune, the ruler of Pisces, is clouding your thoughts. You should try to appear more determined, investing your energy in concrete ambitions. Do not allow yourself to become dependent on the goodwill of others, insist on standing on your own two feet. First, you must overcome your fear and become aware of your great potential. 



In the creative arts, especially music, you are able to impress those around you with your successes. You will reach your life's goal by activating your filter and learning to differentiate the problems that should be addressed from those which do not concern you. You may find strength in faith, Christianity is embodied in the sign Pisces, and the character Jesus Christ may describe the qualities and potential of this sign well. You are capable of honest sympathy and may find your calling in charity work. Be careful of drugs, they can become dangerous more quickly than you think."
14;RADIX_0000000000262146;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Moon;"With this aspect, your emotional state should harmonize well with your will power. You can express all of your energy through your appearance, which is why you are not very good at deception. When you set out to do something, you have to be emotionally committed to your goal. Watch out that you do not just think of yourself, but take other people's feelings into consideration before acting. It may be in your professional interest to go into business for yourself. Then no one will expect you to compromise with colleagues or with the boss.  The results of your business will tell if you are on the right track.



If the Sun forms a conjunction with the Moon, you were born during the new Moon of that month. This is the beginning of a new cycle that applies to the area of the chart where the Sun and the Moon are found. Here you can be especially successful. These sides should harmonize well with each other because the Sun represents male energy and the Moon female.



Your situation at home is very important to you and you will fulfill every requirement to make it as pleasant as possible. You will not let anyone tell you how to run your personal life, because you know exactly what you want."
15;RADIX_0000000000524290;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Mercury;"This aspect grants you the ability to be active in many fields of communication. Primarily for professional and social matters, you are capable of imaginative and productive exchanges. With your wealth of energy you should be able to put your ideas into action.



If Mercury forms an especially close conjunction to the Sun within a radius of 1/2 to 4 degrees, you could be so preoccupied with your ego that your own self-image contradicts how others see you. It is difficult for you to take suggestions from others.



Your astounding intellectual abilities may drain your energy when you do your best not to miss out on anything. Take time to let your many talents recuperate.



You can be very creative and produce a lot of good ideas but be prepared before acting to ensure success. Once in a while it would do you good not to take yourself so seriously and be a little more humble."
16;RADIX_0000000000786434;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Venus;Because you are emotionally intense, decisions are frequently made intuitively. You are usually in a good mood and like to have fun. A well-developed creativity lends itself to expression in music and other arts. Speculating on the market might prove profitable to you, but be wary of illusions in this area. As a people person, you are friendly and jovial. Others appreciate your ability to listen and are happy to be around you. You do not want to be overlooked, you are very aware of the impression you make on others and know how to make yourself remembered in a positive sense, although a little humility now and then would be an improvement.
17;RADIX_0000000001048578;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Mars;"You are decisive and courageous. The house where the Sun and Mars are found are marked by a bustle of activity. The effected areas of your personality will be impressed into your consciousness.



Guard against aggression and arrogance, even if you sense a longing to prove your authority once and for all and are determined to have your way. This behavior causes others to feel threatened, even if you do not want to admit it.



With your creative potential, you should be capable of demonstrating firm resolution in positions of leadership. It is not a matter of what you do, but how you do it. This may lead to conflicts with your colleagues, because willingness to compromise is not one of your strong points."
18;RADIX_0000000001310722;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Jupiter;"The resolute solar energy is supported by the expanding qualities of Jupiter. This aspect enables you to put your individual plans into action and expand your sphere of influence. Others find you charming and appreciate your benevolent and enthusiastic attitudes toward others. This makes you a respected member of society. A positive outlook on life helps you to make optimal use of the situation. At work you are appreciated for you ability to spread enthusiasm and for your social work, and therefore can count on the cooperation of your colleagues and your boss at any time.



In the birth chart, Jupiter is linked to the ninth house and the sign, Sagittarius, the area and the sign that stands for the art of living together. The life concepts that you develop find broad support. This could help launch you into an influential position. It is important to you to lead a full and eventful life that offers lots of opportunities and lets you develop your creative expression."
19;RADIX_0000000001572866;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Saturn;"Saturn, which represents the principle of restriction and limitation, could have a negative influence on your means of expression. This is why you cannot realize your potential until you have identified what has been blocking your way all this time. Do not restrict your search for its cause to the outside world or to other people, but look also within yourself. The relationship to your parents, especially to your father, can play a large role. You should analyze the problem and integrate your insights into your personality.



You will reach your goal only with a lot of effort; do not expect to get anything for free. When you are disappointed you are quick to believe that the demands of life are too much for you. Do not let yourself get pulled down, or you will miss opportunities for growth and development that you really should not let go by. Once you have overcome these hurdles, you will have a right to be proud. Once your confidence develops your organizational talents will bring you considerable success."
20;RADIX_0000000001835010;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Uranus;"The Sun's energy works together with this aspect to keep you constantly on the lookout for new experiences. You are in a position to find out more about esoteric fields. Once you have found an area that arouses your interest, such as Astrology, you will find your own individual way of setting your entire will power on getting to know the area. Anyone who does not understand your way of doing things cannot be helped, in your opinion.



You are surrounded by people who are, like you, enthusiastically anticipating the future. In your relationships you should watch that your uncontrolled temperament does not take center stage. There could be a danger of losing sight of what is important and losing the friends who are dear to you."
21;RADIX_0000000002097154;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Neptune;"You seem to revel in daydreams. All the needs and emotions which play an important role in your life seem to originate from another world. This either leaves you completely confused or gives you a deeper understanding of metaphysical processes.



Do not shut yourself off from current events but continue your education so that you can maintain a balance to your emotions. This conjunction may make it difficult for you to differentiate between reality and fantasy. Neptune arouses some rather unusual expectations that can result in a preoccupation with success and recognition. 



You should learn to become more conscious of reality. Much of what you would perceive will not be to your liking, but the sooner you accept the challenge, the better you will be able to cope with it and stop letting destructive fantasies make your life difficult. If you give up your unrealistic ideas and expectations, you will not suffer so much from disappointments."
22;RADIX_0000000002359298;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Pluto;"This aspect will give you large energy reserves that you and other people can draw from and profit through its influence. With considerable powers you complete your work and do not hesitate to accept every challenge. You understand dimensions of space and time as well as the role of mankind within its framework. Probably you have an intense gaze and plenty of endurance to get to the root of the matter. You have enough depth to get through to other and higher levels of consciousness and to comprehend them. 



Do not make the mistake of placing yourself and your needs above others. Both should be combined together in harmony. Do not let your latent power hunger and your authoritarian tendencies get out of control, otherwise you may end up in isolation. Recognize that everyone has a right to an own opinion."
23;RADIX_0000000008388610;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;"Your entire personality compels you to let go of your past and devote your entire energy to your work. You have enough will power and energy at your disposal to drive your further development. However, under no circumstances should you ignore your natural impulses. If you make peace with yourself in the course of your lifetime, you will be able to follow your path consequently and finally overcome your weaknesses. You will integrate the lessons of your life into your development; at least when you meet challenges in life, you will be ready for them."
24;RADIX_0000000009175042;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"The longing to be someone, combined with your self-content, may actually be preventing you from recognizing how much people like you. When you take something on, you like to realize it in your own way without others giving you orders. It may be difficult for you to submit to the will of other people when the situation requires it. If you should ever experience resistance in your surroundings you should be able to use your creativity successfully.



Making friends is easy for you. If you are not able to win everybody's friendship, you are annoyed. If you would try to restrain your conceit a little, it would do you good."
25;RADIX_0000000009437186;Your Sun in Conjunction with Your MC;"The influential position you have attained both professionally as well as socially will put you in a position to help others. Maybe you are in a profession that involves politics or public appearances. You should definitely consult the remaining aspects to the Sun.



This conjunction can also show that your dominant parent exercised influence over you at an early age and took part in a large portion of your development until now. The relation of the rest of your chart to the Sun and the tenth house will tell if your relationship to this parent is a kind of dependency or a personal challenge."
26;RADIX_0000000000278530;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Moon;If the Sun forms an opposing aspect to the Moon, you were born during the full moon. Everyone knows that a full moon can create a charged atmosphere. You may find it very difficult to make decisions. Your emotional receptivity and will power can constantly be in conflict with each other causing you to experience tensions in dealing with others. Also take care of your health because the Moon and the Sun can have a strong influence on your physical energy. Do something about stress and nervousness. If you do not calm down, your energy reserves will soon be depleted. If you were to try out meditation and relaxation techniques you could resolve your past which would then allow your means of expression to blossom leaving nothing which could be in the way of solving a conflict.
27;RADIX_0000000001064962;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Mars;"This aspect will not be so easily overcome because you tend to be belligerent and hostile, which may manifest itself on a physical level. Possibly you have pronounced aggression, which attracts quarrels like moths to a flame. Become aware of the effects of your aggression on your surroundings and develop more sensitivity.



It would be better for you to divert your excess energy to sports, but watch out that the soccer referee does not show you the red card. Choose your surroundings carefully and use a little more common sense. If you try using diplomacy you will see that not everyone rejects you."
28;RADIX_0000000001327106;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Jupiter;"Try to avoid appearing overenthusiastic and out of touch. The feeling of being constantly under pressure to perform comes from your tendency to pretend to have talents you wish you had. Having never owned a spaceship, you want to bring the stars down from the sky. Sometimes your friends get annoyed because you try to push your ideology on them, which you see as the only valid way of thinking. Try not to develop expectations that are too arrogant and unrealistic; if you overdo it, one day you may find yourself lonely and forsaken.



In striving for recognition and success be sure to call on the right advisor. Maybe you would be better able to recognize your limitations and to leave someone else the jobs that you are not qualified to do. This may result in creative teamwork, which would be a good working environment for you. Stay in touch with the people who gave you your professional training. Let them know you are grateful and you will be able to count on their help in the future."
29;RADIX_0000000001589250;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Saturn;"This is a constellation that can greatly restrict your personal expression. Others may sometimes think that you are distant and humorless. In relations with the opposite sex these qualities will not have an especially positive effect. If you do not do something, you will go down in history as an unapproachable loner. Actually you just want to find out who or what you are.



The primary inhibiting factor to your success has been your inability to like yourself, even a little. Possibly your parents were authoritarian and placed you within boundaries which you were not permitted to overstep. If no space for self-realization was provided for you, then you should simply claim the space you need. There is no sense in waiting for others to take the initiative for you that could take a long time. Instead, use the waiting period to develop a sense of humor, it will certainly be of more use to you."
30;RADIX_0000000001851394;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Uranus;"Getting your way is a top priority for you, whereby you do not always proceed in a very sensible manner. Your concepts of independence and freedom may put some people off. This also causes problems in relationships. The next time you go about changing your convictions, remember to turn on your brain first. Your friends expect to have to constantly redefine their image of you because their experience with you has shown that tomorrow everything may have changed completely. Your hectic pace can cause stress that can have an effect on your physical vitality.



Sometimes you can upset people by insisting on being traditional. Extreme mood swings make it difficult for anyone to be your friend. Do not act impulsively because you are not going to get away with everything, even if you consider yourself to be a genius with extraordinary talents. These talents may actually exist, but ask for advice from others before putting them to use.



Humility and moderate behavior would suit you well. Make more of an effort to get your feet back on the ground because you are truly capable of putting your plans into practice."
31;RADIX_0000000002113538;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Neptune;"This aspect will challenge you on several levels. The lack of a sense of reality may cause problems in your erotic and private relationships. Possibly you are inclined to be intolerant of the weaknesses in your partner. If you do not make more of an effort to be objective, you will have to accept some disappointments. 



A reluctance to make decisions and a general uncertainty about what you should do with your life can become problematic when you unintentionally deceive others and it can provoke unforeseeable reactions. You simply need a better feel for the reality you are confronted with daily. You should not get trapped in your dream world. Once you have understood this, you will be able to grow with the challenges of this aspect."
32;RADIX_0000000002375682;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Pluto;"This aspect gives you a very unique will. You could take your interests so seriously that you violate the needs of others. When you feel misunderstood, you may be inclined to fits of rage or you may pout and sulk, which tends to happen frequently. This should come as no surprise because you only seldom reveal your motives and feelings. In spite of this, you insist that others follow your commands. Open yourself up a little and afford a glimpse at your inner processes to the people closest to you, at the very least. This will make the entire situation easier. The problem is much more than your convictions, it is also the manner in which you express them. Your ideas can be wonderful, but if you cannot express them tactfully; no one will listen to you. Once you have realized this, the inevitable conflicts brought about by your obstinate character can be diverted.



The same processes can also make your love life complicated. It would do you good to practice moderation and behave more reasonably, whereby your ability to compromise would be a great help to you."
33;RADIX_0000000008404994;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;Do not get hung up on your past and refuse to take the next step forward. It is as if you are suppressing your ego to avoid facing new experiences, preferring to live through the tried and true negative experiences one more time. Almost compulsively you continue your familiar patterns of behavior and identify so strongly with them, that you are unable to explain your failure. Try to overcome your inhibitions about opening up and looking more optimistically towards the future. Then you will find friends who can give honest feedback. You need positive energy of the kind indicated by your Sun position so that you can devote more energy to your work.
34;RADIX_0000000009191426;Your Sun in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"Possibly you prefer to let yourself be dominated by others. You are easily impressed and if you do not watch out, you may find yourself in the clutches of people who want to force their strong ego onto you. Go ahead and take yourself a little more seriously, then no one can be as insignificant as you can sometimes feel.



An attraction to successful people may lead you to try to imitate them. Look deeper within yourself, become more aware of your talents and do not try to please others, because you cannot keep it up for long. Your behavior may have been influenced by your relationship to your parents. Become more aware of how strong your ties to them are and think about starting to let go. This will improve your relationships and free more energy that you can then invest in your career."
35;RADIX_0000000009453570;Your Sun in Opposition with Your MC;In the course of achieving your professional position, you will have difficulties with authority figures. Also you may have had conflicts with teachers, bosses and managers. Maybe you were closer to one of your parents and tried to play your parents out against each other in conflict situations. If your parents fought a lot this may have made it very difficult to express yourself. It may be helpful for you to approach your environment ready to cooperate and make compromises. Accept the fact that you will not always have your way.
36;RADIX_0000000000294914;Your Sun in Square with Your Moon;"This aspect causes you to sense a contradiction between your will, your subconscious, your socialization and behavior which can make you feel deeply dissatisfied. Maybe your creative talents lie hidden in darkness. If you cannot find emotional harmony, you will never find a permanent solution to your problems. It is possible that your family is keeping you from expressing your individual qualities.



Look for a means to let off steam or you will hardly experience satisfaction with your life. You fight frequently and your defensiveness does not make your situation any easier. If you should feel a desire to change, you will have to give up your defensive position and take the needs of others more frequently into consideration. This requires a certain amount of effort, only it is not clear how the end result should look. There is, namely, a wide discrepancy between your ideal and your willingness to exert yourself in order to realize it. Be aware that the fulfillment of your personal desires depends on your reaction to the circumstances."
37;RADIX_0000000001081346;Your Sun in Square with Your Mars;"Sometimes your appear temperamental which can be advantageous. You become aggressive or depressed at any kind of restrictions. This leads to a desire to satisfy your needs using any means necessary. This will annoy people because this behavior can be tolerated by almost no one. If you want to avoid arousing anger, make an attempt to restrain yourself. Before doing anything, be sure you know exactly what you want. Make an effort to control your anger and exercise patience and tolerance; this is the only way to achieve your ambitions without entangling yourself in conflicts.



Watch that you do not waste your energies in senseless power struggles. Your talents could bring you much success; merely respect the borders that will be a part of every profession. Independence is important to you, and you should know what you are getting into before tying yourself down professionally or in your private life."
38;RADIX_0000000001343490;Your Sun in Square with Your Jupiter;"Guard against careless action. Possibly you want to put your plans into action without investing a lot of effort. You take on too much and then get frustrated when things do not go as expected. This often results in an exaggerated egotism. Try to relax, even if you are not able to change overnight.



This aspect can point to a tendency for arrogance as well as to excesses in the areas associated with the houses and signs where the Sun and Jupiter are found. You are probably very generous, although you do not give without harboring expectations. Make an effort not to become intolerant; trying to push your ideology on others."
39;RADIX_0000000001605634;Your Sun in Square with Your Saturn;"This square shows that your life is not necessarily an easy one. Probably you will have to overcome a lot of hurdles in your professional life as well as your private life, which will only be feasible with a disciplined approach. Because you may frequently experience disappointments in the course of your life, you should not let them get you down. This is easier said than done, but remember the alternatives. It will not help you to fall into depression and to lament about the state of the world before you have swept in front of your own house.



You may have to make some bitter experiences in the areas of life of the houses where the Sun and Saturn are found. You really have no choice but to work through these experiences and integrate them into your personality.



Success was not handed to you on a silver platter, and you will have to discover your own abilities before you can utilize them effectively. Once you learn to stand resolutely, you should be able to come to terms with life and accept your experiences with an optimistic gaze toward the future."
40;RADIX_0000000001867778;Your Sun in Square with Your Uranus;"With this aspect in your birth chart, you have an inclination to lose touch with reality. Although your inventiveness is limitless, your plans are either too impractical to be applied or are sabotaged by your lack of self-discipline. Your working style is seldom characterized by constancy, but is rather explosive in nature, which can astonish your colleagues.



You can be very stubborn, and with Uranus in the game, you may suddenly bloat up and start taking yourself too seriously. In addition, you loathe all stereotypical processes, which, if you do not watch out, may cause you to wind up in the social discard pile. Try not to get nervous in critical situations or your unpredictable behavior will destroy everything you have built. If you were to take the suggestions of others to heart, your life might take on more constructive contours."
41;RADIX_0000000002129922;Your Sun in Square with Your Neptune;This aspect represents illusion. If you put a lot of effort into an in-depth study of spiritual ideas, be sure to pay attention to the reactions of others, so that you do not approach them as an organ under God's direct command. It may be important to you to be special. It is a noble intention to want to leave a good impression on the planet. Endeavor to serve humanitarian goals with your activities and not just express your eccentric ideas, which do not really have a practical value for others. If you escape into a dream world you will never take responsibility for yourself and discipline will remain a foreign concept. Possibly you have such unrealistic wishes, that their fulfillment could be your ruin. It would do you good to listen to the advice of people you feel close to, who could direct your positive steps in the right direction.
42;RADIX_0000000002392066;Your Sun in Square with Your Pluto;"A thirst for influence gives you the tendency to want to dominate others and lets you appear impulsive and authoritarian. Although your only intention is to show others that you want to be closer to them, sometimes you have trouble being honest with others and then wonder why some people avoid you. You do not talk about your motivation or your thoughts very often. Still, you are stubborn and always insist on having the last word, which does not exactly bring the people around you to stand up and cheer.



Try to open up somewhat. Go to other people and do not expect anyone to follow you without contradiction. This will help you get a grip on your egotism. If you become more humble and conform to the circumstances, you will probably discover another side of your personality."
43;RADIX_0000000008421378;Your Sun in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;You are resisting the lessons of life too vehemently and also refuse to suffer the consequences of your experiences. You put yourself under pressure chasing success and do not want to admit that fundamental changes in your behavior are necessary. Sometimes you are not able to see the forest for the trees. Take a closer look at the problems with your Sun position and remember that you have been given every opportunity, if you could just recognize it. Reliable friends, willing to support you on your life's journey with good advice and who will not hesitate to hit you with the truth, would be of great help to you.
44;RADIX_0000000009207810;Your Sun in Square with Your Ascendant;"With this aspect you should watch out that you do not overemphasize your relationships with others, this will not necessarily arouse enthusiasm. Maybe you should become more aware of the way you treat people. If you could learn to make compromises, your relationships would be more satisfying.



A great problem could be a lack of honesty, which you do not want to realize in spite of the criticism you receive. Your desire to be liked everywhere you go may be pronounced, but will only be fulfilled if you learn to be humble. Let people get closer to you then you will see that people will feel more comfortable around you.



If you are used to opposition, you will have learned to deal with backslides and to see them as character building experiences. Do not react too aggressively, that can cause problems especially at work. If you can learn to express your views with sensitivity, you would be happier."
45;RADIX_0000000009469954;Your Sun in Square with Your MC;"In the course of achieving your professional position, you will have difficulties with authority figures; you may have had conflicts with teachers, bosses and managers. Conflicts with your parents may have made it very difficult for you to express yourself. It may be helpful for you to approach your environment ready to cooperate and compromise. Accept the fact that you will not always have your way."
46;RADIX_0000000000311298;Your Sun in Trine with Your Moon;"This harmonious aspect should help you to develop a mature personality capable of creative expression with health and strength enough to recover from life's defeats quickly.



It should be possible to achieve a balance between the masculine and feminine sides of your personality. Also you should be able to maintain a warm relation to your environment, because you are joyful and confident. 



Take care not to remain passively in the background when your help is needed. As with all harmonious aspects, there is a danger of getting lazy when things are going well. You have more than enough creative talent that you can use profitably when dealing with people if you could only get motivated. People are moved by you and will hold onto the memories of their encounters with you for a long time."
47;RADIX_0000000001097730;Your Sun in Trine with Your Mars;"Confront life bravely and act with intent, whereby you always try to be constructive. You are capable of great athletic achievements and your energy level is always high. Since you have a weakness for athletic competition you are determined to always come out as winner. Testing your limits holds a special attraction for you.



You have a good sense of self-esteem and integrity. No one would call you lazy, and you master complicated situations brilliantly. Your greatest advantage is knowing that you can use your abilities practically and constructively.



This aspect foretells a strong fire component because both the Sun and Mars are associated with fire signs. People consider you to be an enthusiastic representative of the human species and they encourage you to participate."
48;RADIX_0000000001359874;Your Sun in Trine with Your Jupiter;"The temperamental and optimistic nature of this aspect has an effect on moral and social affairs. Your attitude has both generous and selfish characteristics, which serve to open the hearts of others and offer you opportunities for further development.



A large energy reserve, both physical and mental, allows you to lead a satisfying life and also support people less fortunate than you. You are an honest person, abide by the law and act according to the norms of morality. Your intuitive vision allows you an occasional peek into the future. Sometimes you feel like fleeing civilization; then you retreat into nature.



It may be difficult to find a way to use your creative energies sensibly. You have an inclination to occasionally step back and remain passive. As with every harmonious aspect there is a danger of becoming too passive, when things are going well. Go ahead and take on a little more."
49;RADIX_0000000001622018;Your Sun in Trine with Your Saturn;"This trine is a sign that your pursuit of success will bring results faster than it would to others. This is primarily because you do not mind taking on responsibility. Your outlook on life leads one to assume that you are honest, practical and crazy. Both finances and your own energy are used sparingly, whereby you apply both primarily to realizing practical and sensible plans. Your power of concentration and your organizational talents are put to use in a disciplined manner, even when you are pursuing ambitious goals; they are achieved due to sacrificial effort.



You are not necessarily lucky in a traditional sense of the word, but you tend intuitively to do the right thing at the right time, such that you will never suffer poverty in difficult times. Your sober rationality has put together financial reserves to get you over any time of need. You have learned to be patient and to avoid risky enterprises."
50;RADIX_0000000001884162;Your Sun in Trine with Your Uranus;"This aspect together with your creative energy will help you win people over. You are able to tap into an energy reservoir that is not readily available to others. Sometimes problems that you have been struggling with for a long time suddenly solve themselves. The esoteric field of study should actually fascinate you and if you sense a desire to take a closer look at Astrology, you should definitely follow up on it. It has already lead many people to a more comprehensive understanding of life's basic regularities.



Generally you are open to experimentation because you know that it will broaden your experiences. Also you have nothing against sharing proposals you have developed with people who are dissatisfied with the existing social conditions. However, you insist on working toward a peaceful goal by peaceful means. In light of the wars being fought presently, your humanitarian outlook brings you to believe that more solidarity is what the world needs most.



The effect you have on your surroundings is fundamentally positive, largely because you are able to keep your interests in the background. People tend to feel motivated when they work with you and generate new energies that can support their efforts to direct their own lives into directions that will lead to satisfaction. People know that you will take their problems seriously. Concern that you may need help someday serves as a motivation to give to others."
51;RADIX_0000000002146306;Your Sun in Trine with Your Neptune;"This aspect should fill you with spiritual capacities that are definitely noticeable in your emotional make-up and are brought out in artistic and musical activities. Sympathy and your inclination to altruistic love are so pronounced that these traits will find ways of expressing themselves on all levels.



Express your ideas clearly and understandably, otherwise you could lose yourself in irrational dreams that the people around you cannot accept. The danger is not very great and you are probably capable of structuring your life so that you instinctively do the right thing. You let yourself be driven, but also recognize opportunity when it presents itself and can take advantage of it. You even gain insights into economic aspects."
52;RADIX_0000000002408450;Your Sun in Trine with Your Pluto;"No matter what you do, you get actively involved in it and are ready to make necessary corrections in your life. With your power, determination and stamina, you could achieve a lot of good for humanity and set positive goals for yourself. Your activities may under no circumstances go unnoticed. Generally, you recognize the situation immediately and can participate in the course of events according to a plan.



Perhaps you are interested in esoteric fields or have spiritual powers. You are like a clown, quick to get back on your feet. Perhaps you have a guardian angel that never lets you down. Probably your creative talent will come to life only after you have suffered some defeats. Do not make the mistake of hiding your light under a bushel just because the harmony in this aspect makes you sluggish. Overcome your reluctance to participate. You have the power to realize plans which others do not dare to dream of."
53;RADIX_0000000008437762;Your Sun in Trine with Your Northern Moon Node;"This is a nice aspect, which can help you to accept life's lessons. Someday you will have to let go of your past and accept that your personality is subject to transformations. Probably, most people like you because you are friendly and honest. You can accept life's challenges without great difficulty, especially when you meet them at the appropriate time.



Naturally, such a harmonious aspect harbors the danger of letting you get overconfident or arrogant because success seems to come without effort.  If you make yourself aware of the problem, you should be able to find a way to solve it."
54;RADIX_0000000009224194;Your Sun in Trine with Your Ascendant;"Use the vitality you were given at birth and make use of the opportunities it presents. Sometimes it may be difficult because of the tendencies in your life to become passive and even lazy. Actually you are an optimistic person radiating self-confidence. This puts you in a position to win the support of the people around you.



With your creative abilities you should be able to exercise a profession which will allow your self-fulfillment and also provide financial security for your old age. Recognition from others is very important. If you do not exaggerate your need for approval, you should be very successful."
55;RADIX_0000000009486338;Your Sun in Trine with Your MC;When it comes to your position in society you go about things skillfully and are quick to identify your interests. Probably you will concentrate your attention on balancing family life and profession. This mixture will help you to establish harmonious relations to both of your parents, just as it was during your childhood.
56;RADIX_0000000000327682;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Moon;"With this sextile in your chart you should have ample opportunity to make something out of your life. Use your talent to initiate friendships and keep them. Your relationships to the opposite sex are stable. People tend to like you, respect you and recognize your accomplishments.



If you have kids, you should be capable of taking care of them because an intense feeling of love and friendship bonds you to others.



This aspect has a positive effect on both your health and life energy. Working through your past is no problem for you and you do not see why you should drag it up again in order to construct the present. You are completely satisfied with your present situation and you are grateful that you have everything you need to develop a reasonable future for yourself and your family."
57;RADIX_0000000001114114;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Mars;"This aspect foretells risk-taking and large reserves of energy. Willingness to take on adventures and initiate concepts makes it easy to keep a lot of friends around who have similar convictions and are willing to offer their advice because you often accept it.



In the houses where Mars and the Sun are found, activity and creativity will be intensified. It is easy for you to get your way. You enjoy criticizing social conditions where more justice is called for. Once you have set your mind on something you will throw yourself in to its realization. Whereby no effort is too great and no journey too long. Sometimes you can proceed energetically, which is generally not criticized but becomes a problem when you take on too much."
58;RADIX_0000000001376258;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Jupiter;"You look confidently into the future. Your personal guardian angel seems to accompany your every step, because you only seldom experience serious difficulties. If you do ever get distracted, you find a way out of your misery quickly, because you instinctively know how to open locked doors.



People should benefit from your activities. In moral questions you are well versed through your study of the realization of spiritual and humanistic principles. You know what you want and you will realize everything you set out to do.



If you have started a family you are aware of your responsibilities and will do everything in your power to provide your children with a loving environment to grow up in. Your remarkable spiritual faculties will make your life pleasant. This does not necessarily imply elaborate activities; you are satisfied with simple everyday life. Travel is important to you because you have great interest in foreign cultures. With foreigners you enjoy friendly and intense exchanges."
59;RADIX_0000000001638402;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Saturn;"This aspect is responsible for disciplined behavior and transparent thoughts. Organizational skills help you to apply methods to the realization of your goals and recognize and understand complex relations as well as organize businesses efficiently. In order to put your ambitious plans into action, you are going to have to make demands. It is important to approach all aspects of life honestly, your business partners and everyone else with whom you associate, should be able to rely on you. Loyalty is more than just an empty word to you, even if it seems unattainable at times.



If you have political ambitions, go for it. This aspect makes it possible to fill positions of responsibility in good conscience. If you take on such a position, you will make sure to keep yourself informed of every new development. Care and prudence will assure you of good heath and prosperity, which you have earned honestly. You get along well with people who share your convictions. Look for a partner who does not reject your values and is willing to construct a livable future with you."
60;RADIX_0000000001900546;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Uranus;"This aspect should be endowed with a good portion of imagination and inspiration. Because you are open and have large energy reserves you will achieve what you set out to do. Your strong power of attraction evokes enthusiasm and makes people trust you. You would do well to go into a profession dealing with the improvement of the conditions in society. Expressing attitudes and ideas clearly is one of your strong points, whereby you are also adept at reacting to contradictory standpoints without aggression.



What makes you so popular is a friendly personality. Nothing will be able to stop your progress. Your well-developed intuition enables you to spontaneously assess a situation. Possibly you are interested in esoteric fields of study, especially Astrology.



Your intellect is alive and active, which pleases your potential lover. Liberal attitudes are responsible for your leniency with small human weaknesses. However, if your partner is being dishonest or treats you unfairly, you cannot tolerate it and will end the relationship."
61;RADIX_0000000002162690;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Neptune;"This aspect encourages an intuitive imagination that can find a place for its development in the arts. Moral and esoteric subjects are also important to you. You think not only in terms of the present but consider the future as well. Take some time to consider the fields of writing, the fine arts and music more carefully, you have enough creative energy to express yourself brilliantly.



Even though you know of ways to reduce suffering in your immediate environment you leave this area to others who have more practical experience and feel chosen for this work. This does not mean that you do not have considerable sympathy for the situation of others. The popularity you enjoy is actually due to your sympathy."
62;RADIX_0000000002424834;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Pluto;"With your energy reserves you are in a position to help others and enjoy doing so, especially if they are in a miserable situation they get out of it on their own. When you act, it is under the motto, ""help to self-help"", which is why you reject pity and will never let yourself be used. Bring out your strength of character and proceed tactically. A nearly invisible and influential power is emitted through your person and creates endurance. Even when you think you are completely exhausted you can tap into the hidden energy of the universe. A study of yoga and meditation will help you to bring your esoteric abilities under control.



Anyone who hears you feels drawn to you because you have recognized connections and know what you are talking about. Acquire an ability to communicate and use it to search for the hidden talents of others. Use the trust people place in you not only for your own goals, but to contribute to a better standard of living for everyone on the planet."
63;RADIX_0000000008454146;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Northern Moon Node;"This is a nice aspect, which can help you to accept life's lessons. Someday you will have to let go of your past and accept that your personality is subject to transformations. Probably, most people like you because you are friendly and honest. You can accept life's challenges without great difficulty, especially when you meet them at the appropriate time.



Naturally such a harmonious aspect harbors the danger of letting you get overconfident or arrogant because success seems to come without effort. If you make yourself aware of the problem, you should be able to find a way to solve it."
64;RADIX_0000000009240578;Your Sun in Sextile with Your Ascendant;"It should not be difficult for you to realize your creativity. The skillful way you express yourself makes others enjoy listening to your rhetorical considerations, which are not only carried out in an awe inspiring manner but are also quite convincing. You are everyone's friend and expect that people feel comfortable with you. Because your humor is contagious, you can liven up any gathering.



Professionally, you should watch out that you do not take on too much, as if you never had the opportunity to stand out and be recognized. Maybe you appear so self-confident that your bosses may start to worry about their jobs.



In your circles you are known for being charming and nice and when it comes to making contacts which may be useful later, you astound even yourself. It seems you are only interested in honest friendships with the people closest to you. For dishonesty, you have absolutely no tolerance in a friendship. It can be the cause of you breaking off the relationship, and then it will be very difficult to win back your trust."
65;RADIX_0000000009502722;Your Sun in Sextile with Your MC;When it comes to your position in society you go about things skillfully and are quick to identify your interests. Probably you will concentrate your attention on balancing family life and profession. This mixture will help you to establish harmonious relations to both of your parents, just as it was during your childhood.
66;RADIX_0000000000000006;Your Sun in the First House;"If the Sun is in the first house in your chart, then you entered the world within the first two hours of the new Day. Daylight dispels the black of night and people begin to go about their daily tasks.



The exceptional energy radiating from the Sun in this position is not without effect. This is the source of your destiny to serve as an example and to give others strength and energy. Greet life actively and enthusiastically making your way with determination. Your family was not necessarily the primary contributors to your confidence and optimism. You prefer to earn success completely independently and it has brought you a certain amount of respect, which you also crave for. You are the kind of person who wants to stand out in a crowd. It is important for you to know enough about everything to be considered an authority on any subject. This also satisfies your craving for admiration.



Probably you are seldom sick, although a consultation of the sign housing the Sun and its aspects to the other planets is necessary to confirm this. If the Sun and the Ascendant are in the same sign, the qualities of that sign will be especially pronounced.



If the Sun in the first house receives harmonious aspects, you may have had a childhood which made it easy for you to develop your unique capacities, and your birth caused much excitement.



If the Sun in the first house receives challenging aspects, you should take care not to give free reign to your dominant character traits, such as narcissism, and pride.



If you do not manage to regulate your desire to be in control you will end up frustrated and off-balance. Always remember that respect and recognition have to be earned. Do not make the mistake of expecting too much."
67;RADIX_0000000000016390;Your Sun in the Second House;"In humanistic Astrology, the second house is called the ""test of possession"", in which you are supposed to learn to deal actively and dynamically with material possessions; to recognize their usefulness but not to become overly attached or worship your growing accumulation of things. Live out your individual talents and improve the awareness of yourself by internalizing important values. You have to recognize what security actually means if you seriously intend to fulfill your wish to become independent. Your satisfaction in life comes from acquiring possessions and from your talent to get along in the physical world. This is one area where you progress with your head held high. Possibly you want to make your way into the scene by impressing others with status symbols. You share your material possessions with others, but should learn not to try to turn a profit from it.



The development of the Sun's energy in the second house is advantageous for you, because you have enough energy to withstand the tests to your detachment. Finally you could develop enough self-assurance to rise above all the challenges of life. This stable base depends on your confidence as well as your financial situation. It is worth trying for even if it does sound a bit pompous."
68;RADIX_0000000000032774;Your Sun in the Third House;"Do not be intimidated by what others might say, bring out the best in your own ideas, insights and points of view. Opening yourself more to others will strengthen your self-confidence. You are at your best while expanding your knowledge or sharing your acquired learning and inspirations with others. The Sun in the third house awakens a desire to be the center of attention. This can aggravate conflicts with siblings, neighbors or relatives, which you actually should be trying to solve. It is important that you avoid making others responsible for your needs and actions.  Try to avoid overemphasizing abstract knowledge.



Inharmonious Aspects to the Sun in the third house may have caused problems in your first years of school. In order to prevent this from effecting your education you should analyze any problems you may have in this area and attempt to find solutions.



Although you make an intelligent and eloquent impression on people, this does not satisfy you. You put everything you have into improving your general education in order to interact more brilliantly with others."
69;RADIX_0000000000049158;Your Sun in the Fourth House;"In humanistic Astrology, the fourth house stands for the test of stability. In your search, you will have to delve deep within yourself, whereby you will have to find a balance between the necessary material prerequisites for life, which probably are less important to you, and your spiritual progression, including your family life.



Put yourself in a position that lets you see yourself as an independent individual, without having to deny your roots. This is important, because you may both identify with your ancestry and allow your family too much influence over you, or out of a desire to protect yourself from their influence, completely reject your background. It would do you good to try to accept some of your family's values without sacrificing your own identity.



The fourth house is the mother's house, which is essential to a strong sense of security in the early years. The energies unfolding in this house can be experienced through the mother. Your mother may be strong and dominating which may cause you to suffer from permanent self-doubt and think of yourself as a weakling. You should tell your mother what you think of her in order to free yourself from her influence. It may be that your mother was not there for you, either physically or emotionally, which has left you with an unrealistic image of her. In any case, the Sun in the fourth house presents a challenge to look for and find the feminine potential within yourself.



Most probably you have a deep longing to establish a safe and comfortable home to live in. You still need a little time to find the place where it feels right to settle down. Do not expect to find real satisfaction or develop a realistic self-image until later in life."
70;RADIX_0000000000065542;Your Sun in the Fifth House;"In your chart the Sun finds itself in the house which is, as the Sun itself is, ruled by the sign Leo. Working enthusiastically toward a goal will help develop your character.



Your physical and mental stability is dependent on your ability to communicate your current emotional state to others. If you have trouble deciding which goal to dedicate yourself to, it could have an effect on your health. Your state of health may also suffer from stress due to a work overload. Make decisions about your life's work fully conscious of the consequences and try to be satisfied without overloading yourself. 



You may sense the child within you constantly demanding attention. Even when others tell you that you are creative, you still demand more perfection from yourself. The Sun principle is set for continual expansion. The fifth house concentrates on developing means of self-expression and creative potential.



Utilize you artistic potential in any way you can. This does not imply becoming a second Beethoven or Picasso, but merely any form of creative expression. If you think you can accomplish something in this area, go for it and do not let anyone talk you out of it.



Your love of life finds expression in your hobbies and other leisure activities. Erotic affairs and romantic relationships will immeasurably increase your enthusiasm and your self-confidence. Contact with children not only makes you happy but also offers instruction as an additional reward. You should never expect things of your child that you are not capable of doing yourself. Especially in Germany after the Second World War, it was common for parents to project their unfulfilled wishes onto their children. They wanted to provide their children with a better life than they had, but the children were never asked about their opinion. Avoid grooming your child for presentation as your achievement.



Most probably you enjoy being the center of attention. A challenging aspect of the Sun in this house could induce you to call attention to yourself by any means at your disposal."
71;RADIX_0000000000081926;Your Sun in the Sixth House;"The Sun in the sixth house will bring you to concentrate your activities on getting your life together. You look after your health, daily routines and your career. You should not get too wrapped up in this, but take on projects that will allow you to improve the spiritual aspects of both your health and general quality of life. At the start, small physical and psychological weaknesses may point to parts of your life which you should look at more carefully.



Try to achieve harmony of body and mind. Take care of your health ahead of time; do not wait until you get sick. If your health is already suffering, it is more important than ever to take care of yourself and find your way back to a holistic lifestyle. Once you have succeeded, nothing will stand in the way of a consultation with others on these topics.



It is important to you to structure your everyday routine as efficiently as possible, clearing up any problems that may hinder you. Developing practical skills will give you character. Do not spend your day dawdling and dreaming. It is possible to achieve insight into the most elemental truths while doing the most boring housework. You probably will not get away with your attempts to avoid restrictions and deny your failures. Once you accept this you will be rewarded with strength and understanding. This does not necessarily have to be apparent to everyone else, what is important is that you are satisfied. You may be amazed at its effect on everything you do.



Work on perfecting your skills and find a sensible way to incorporate them at your workplace, you will find it reassuring. Helping others will prove to be fulfilling."
72;RADIX_0000000000098310;Your Sun in the Seventh House;"The Sun in the seventh house helps you to develop your friendships, partnerships, your self-confidence and your character. Common activities will raise questions that will inspire you to get to know yourself and to express yourself better. Putting more effort into making honest and upright friendships will improve your character. Surely you know that usually things become clearer by comparison. This is also true for character; it will receive definition through contact to others.



Watch out that you do not hide behind someone else, if you are looking for someone you think will compensate for your weaknesses or for someone to give you direction. You may attempt to gain status or power by attaching yourself to someone powerful who you can worship. Seen psychologically, you may be actually searching for your father. You will never find fulfillment anywhere but within yourself. Anyone else you try to burden with this will probably just leave.



In humanistic Astrology, the test of cooperation is ascribed to the seventh house. Here your relation to the environment is structured. You need to be around people and should choose a profession that will bring you into contact with a lot of people."
73;RADIX_0000000000114694;Your Sun in the Eighth House;"You long for a union with a ""superior being"", even if this is not conscious and you deny it to yourself. Try to expand your horizons through more personal contacts and exchanges.



The eighth house stands for other people's life resources. You may strengthen your identity by falling back onto the material possessions of your friends, especially if they have already offered their assistance. You could fulfill your wish to invest your energy in large projects by professionally handling other people's finances.



It is not just the material exchange that is important, but also the emotional. If you have an emotional nature your friendships will bring hidden character traits and unresolved childhood problems to the surface as well as further your development and individual expression associated with the Sun. An erotic relationship can serve to vent frustration and stimulate regeneration and healing after a collapse. You will get the maximum benefit from an intensive relationship with someone of the opposite sex. This will provide all the aggravation you need to progress.



Generally, the eighth house is associated with death and inheritance. Death holds a special fascination for you which causes you to address topics which others avoid. It is to be hoped that you will be able to deal with everything you stir up."
74;RADIX_0000000000131078;Your Sun in the Ninth House;"With this Sun position you should endeavor to expand your horizons. Take trips, read, and take up philosophy. Your understanding for the interrelatedness of every aspect of life and your intellectual potential could lead to fruitful insights on all levels. You should also be capable of exercising various professions. Probably you are suited for professions that put you in a position to act in public. You could be successful in any branch of the travel industry, whereby you prefer the most distant exotic countries. Generally, you are good at motivating people and at transmitting your ideas, knowledge and enthusiasm. 



You think of life as an experiment. Rigidly following traditional or even outdated philosophies of life is not what it is all about. You want to explore various esoteric fields, philosophies and religions on your search for your own individual truth. You will learn about yourself through exchanges with others.



Take care not to lose touch with reality. You have a tendency to devote yourself to macrocosmic theory. You can plan your future completely ignoring the problems of your present personal situation. It can go so far that your awareness for the well being of humanity leaves no room for you to find answers to your personal questions."
75;RADIX_0000000000147462;Your Sun in the Tenth House;"This position of the Sun brings your personal development in the context of your professional life. The tenth house concerns itself with the character traits that generate a positive echo from others. In humanistic Astrology, the tenth house is the test of your position, in which the position of a person is defined frequently by their profession. You should pay attention to the sign housing the Sun. It will tell you how the Sun's energy is manifested. 



You also feel a strong desire for recognition. You will do your best, but when you climb for success, be sure that it is not on the backs of others. A little determination never hurt anyone, but the history books are full of characters that overdid it in this respect.



The tenth house is the father's house. You may have identified so strongly with your father that you took on his ambitions as your own. As a father in turn, you could harbor the expectation that your child develops according to your plan. You should take care not to suffocate your child with your personality. Actually, it could develop into a form of symbiosis. Your child, who is ecstatic about any opportunity to demonstrate her talents, would idolize you.



If you have not managed to fulfill your professional ambitions, you may be looking for a relationship with a successful man. Conflicts between professional and private lives could present problems for both sexes in this position. If you want to pursue a career, you should go for it, but be assured that the consequences will include restrictions on your private life. The best solution would be to find your individual professional expression within yourself, which allows you to combine your career with your private life."
76;RADIX_0000000000163846;Your Sun in the Eleventh House;"If the Sun is in the eleventh house, social, political or charitable endeavors will help to define your character. As you develop your individuality, make sure that it is bound to something that will make you aware of your collective existence. You could gain respect and recognition through group activities which may eventually lead to a high position or to increased influence over your own or other organizations. Your actual experiences in the group and the results of your activities will depend on the Sun's aspects in this house. 



To advance your development you will need to intensify contacts with your friends. Reciprocal giving and taking will be inspiring and support the realization of your ambitions. Naturally, your goals should be realistic. They will consume a large amount of energy and it would be a shame if the effort were wasted. Your efforts will reflect in your character. 



You could pioneer new movements and trends that influence society. Take care that you do not identify too strongly with a group that has a dogmatic ideology. You do not want to completely sacrifice your individuality.



Retain the ability to differentiate between your own opinions and the ideology the group wants to sell you."
77;RADIX_0000000000180230;Your Sun in the Twelfth House;"In humanistic Astrology, the twelfth house is a place for spring-cleaning. This may seem confusing at first, but the twelfth house is the end of a cycle that is renewed in the first house. Something should happen here to prepare the way for a more beautiful new beginning. The twelfth house will also help each individual attain its highest potential, although the energies at work here are collective by nature and serve to restrain the ego.



This recognition and mastery can be compared with untying a knot. When the ego and communal spirit melt together latent gifts may awaken within you. You have the capacity to pioneer new fields. Your visions of a peaceful and ecological planet Earth should definitely be made available to others, whereby you could creatively move others through the arts. Your ability to see beyond your own shadow enables you to recognize the needs of others and generally lend assistance to efforts designed to rectify unacceptable conditions both in the society at large or in your immediate surroundings. Dare to instigate reform, a time may come when you will not have any other choice.



If the Sun has a challenging aspect in the twelfth house you may have to fight against false pride, conceit and arrogance.  This may lead you to assume that all the world's benefits are laid out for you to take what you want with no concern for the rest of the world.



On another level, the twelfth house deals with institutions. The Sun indicates that various institutions could eventually play a role in your life, whether professionally or privately. This includes hospitals, charitable institutions or stations in which people are confined.



You are very sensitive and notice signals from your surroundings. This makes it necessary for you to withdraw periodically to maintain enough distance necessary to clear your head. You will have to watch out that the circumstances do not eat into you to the point where you are unable to live a normal life."
78;RADIX_0000000000000068;The Moon - The Emotional Attitude;"The Moon does not travel around the Earth in an exact circular orbit but moves elliptically. Its diameter is approximately 3500 kilometers making it a tiny speck of dust in the universe. People have found its constantly changing form fascinating, giving rise to innumerable myths, legends and tales. While the Sun is associated with male consciousness, the Moon is seen as female. Women's menstrual cycles are in accord with the 28-day Moon cycles. Moon goddesses have been described diversely as moody, dark and cruel or as life giving and sensitive. They have been called Demeter, Hera, Artemis, Hecate or Persephone. Even the Virgin Mary has been often portrayed as a Moon crescent.



The Moon's influence on the Earth and its inhabitants should not be underestimated. If it is responsible for the changes in tide, why shouldn't it also alter our body fluids?



The phase of the Moon at the time of birth is a very important facet of astrological interpretation. The waning Moon is a period for concentration and gathering, with all energies turned inward. The new Moon is the climax of this development. The waxing Moon is the opposite, a time for growth and allowing emotions to be expressed freely. Everyone has at least once in his or her lifetime spent restless or even sleepless nights on a full Moon. Quite a few locations like Koh Phangan in Thailand or Goa in India have institutionalized ""Full Moon Parties"" which attract thousands of people at a time.



In a horoscope the Moon is associated with the sign Cancer and represents the subconscious, emotional disposition, fertility, creative energies, the home, family, mother and the reception of other people's moods. You can tell if someone tends to be moody or emotionally stable."
79;RADIX_0000000000000065;Your Moon in Aries;"You are an adventurer known for your longing for independence, in spite of its contradiction to the qualities of the moon which tend more toward a desire for warmth and security. You can make a restless impression on people and go to great lengths to repress your fear of commitment. You find it difficult to appreciate your feminine side or to take responsibility for the welfare of others. A stable relationship makes you feel like you are bound and chained. It will take you a long time to get over this and make concessions for a relationship. You need to be able to do what you want when you want and often act spontaneously. 



It is important to you to be honest with other people and to show your true self. Do not let anyone lay a guilt trip on you. Others appreciate your motivation and the fact that you never allow yourself to be a burden on anyone. You accept responsibility yourself if one of your risky ventures fails. You like to fight and are determined. You make your way through life alone. You were probably left on your own at a young age and were not offered much of a feeling of security in your childhood."
80;RADIX_0000000000016449;Your Moon in Taurus;"With the Moon in Taurus you will need a stable emotional foundation. You want to know where you stand and do not let yourself avoid confrontations. Anyone entering a relationship with you cannot hold back, you must be able to rely on them. You need warmth and attention but also have a lot to give. Once you are sure of yourself you are able to let others depend on you. You are an easygoing person. Once your needs are satisfied you lead a contented life. Your acute physical awareness tells you when you have eaten enough and when you need a change in diet.



If you live according to your needs and emotions, you could find yourself indulging in material comforts and consuming compulsively. You may become covetous, overweight and trapped in a monotone life that restricts your freedom.



Your childhood was loving and caring, you never had to complain about a lack of attention or security. Your parents may have spoiled you, making you sometimes appear demanding. Use your abilities to provide yourself with a protective environment and enjoy life. Your relationships are probably lasting which will eventually give you the self-confidence to be spontaneous and take risks. You will find that it pays not to try to plan everything in life."
81;RADIX_0000000000032833;Your Moon in Gemini;"The Moon in Gemini can vary. You may sometimes feel torn between two options because you have the insight to understand the emotional implications of both. You often cannot decide what it is you really need. You crave contact and communication with others, but often avoid opening yourself up out of fear of being trapped. You may not really find peace until late in life. You let yourself be distracted too easily and find that you have tried everything but have no real accomplishments to show for it. Your natural curiosity leads you to a lot of new experiences but often prevents you from taking the time to really digest them. Learning something new and making yourself understood are two things that make you happy. You are able to impress people not only with hard facts, but also by using your imagination and eloquence. You like to express your emotions and talk a lot about yourself. You also notice immediately if someone is keeping something from you that you should know about. You communicate with sensitivity, which you often use to end disputes among others. Your friends come to you with their problems because you always have an open ear. It is important for you to learn to listen attentively to things you would rather not know about.



Your childhood may have been turbulent, filled with changing influences, which challenged you intellectually but did not make you feel secure enough."
82;RADIX_0000000000049217;Your Moon in Cancer;"The Moon is found in Cancer, where it rules, making it a strong influence in your horoscope. It will express itself differently according to your emotional contentment. Your emotional well being is more dependent on your childhood and family ties than is the case with other people. If you were overprotected and had to fight a domineering mother as a child, you may never become independent and may still rely on childish tricks to get your way. You can be defiant and insistent about getting what you want, because you never learned to share. You may make the same mistake as your mother and not let go when a cycle has come to an end. You feel useless when you do not have any one who you lets you take care of them and tolerate your suffocating them with your ""love"".



The Moon in Cancer can also be pleasant. If you find inner harmony you can give love and attention to others like no one else can. You create a protective environment and let your partners know that they can rely on you. You use sensitivity to find out what is going on inside others and do everything you can to help them. Your self-confidence comes from deep within you and cannot be easily taken away. You are well balanced and radiate steadfastness without trying to prove anything to others. You are happiest when everyone around you is doing well."
83;RADIX_0000000000065601;Your Moon in Leo;"You probably fall in love often, you tend to be emotional and always want to feel that you are alive. You like to spend time with others and fall apart if you do not get enough attention. This makes you dependent on other peoples' feelings. Try instead to really like yourself, even though you already give this impression. Your emotional state is very complex, but you have a lot of love to give. Everyone around you is aware of what you are going through because you never found it necessary to make a secret of your passions and feelings. Rejection confuses you and makes you wonder what puts others off. Your resolution and your self-confidence can make others fear being encompassed by you.



Probably you lacked nothing in your childhood. Your parents may have consciously or unconsciously raised you as a little prince or princess. If you experienced the other aspect of Leo Energy, and were oppressed or tyrannized then you probably lack self-confidence today. Once you learn to accept yourself together with all your faults without waiting for the reaction of an audience, you will graciously take on the problems of those around you."
84;RADIX_0000000000081985;Your Moon in Virgo;"The Moon can feel uneasy in Virgo. Our emotions have nothing to do with perfection and cannot always be explained rationally. You can fight off all irrational emotions by tooth and nail and refuse to express negative feelings. You may be keeping to yourself and avoiding anything unpredictable to evade being touched by any kind of passion. If you succeed in closing yourself off you will stifle yourself in solitude. You should recognize your own value and start to accept yourself and not be so critical of your faults.



You may have been raised to be a perfectionist, not allowed to make a single mistake. Your parents may have given you physical comfort but no warmth and understanding. This makes it hard for you to show your feelings and begin a relationship today. You may feel restricted and battle illnesses that are expressions of your suppressed emotions.



Once you have found inner harmony and are secure and satisfied, the Moon in Virgo will show its other side. You will know exactly what you need to secure your own happiness and will not let yourself be confused. You sacrifice yourself for those around you and take great pleasure in helping people. You find joy in simple things and are especially sensitive to your body's signals."
85;RADIX_0000000000098369;Your Moon in Libra;"Your greatest desire is to live in harmony with your feelings. You need to be loved and are prepared to do anything for your partner to make peace and balance. You are sensitive to conflicts and negative energies and get nervous and depressed easily. You run the risk of becoming too dependent on what others think of you and basing your own self-image on their acceptance. The only way for you to find emotional stability is to learn to love yourself. 



You crave harmony and usually get along well with everyone, if you only resist the temptation to evade conflicts at all cost. People like you because you are willing to help others even when it is to your own disadvantage. You work well in teams because you have learned the art of compromising and are open to new ideas. You love art and have a good taste and a sense of style. You are attracted to beauty. Your artistic and aesthetic development was encouraged in your childhood home.



It is important for you to take a firm position, even if it is at the cost of peace and harmony. You can develop your self-esteem by reminding yourself that perfection in human relationships never existed and never will. Permit yourself to initiate a conflict to protect your interests."
86;RADIX_0000000000114753;Your Moon in Scorpio;"Your greatest challenge will be to keep your temperament under control and to withstand the trials of passion. You are capable of feeling deeply; depending on the foundations of your emotions you can love beyond all limits or develop a passionate loathing. You must learn not to give in to your feelings because they contain explosive potential. As you mature you will find that you are better able to control your emotions and will no longer give in to every temptation.



You long to live out your passions and could lead an active sex life. You are open to new experiences, recover from deep wounds quickly and are ready for the next adventure. You feel obliged to bend rules, overstep bounds and break taboos. This does not necessarily make you well loved by all those around you; still you are appreciated for making things happen. Be careful not to go too far, do not ignore pain you may cause to others or you may find yourself lonesome someday, even if you consider yourself a loner and avoid attaching yourself to larger social groups, do not underestimate the importance of your friends."
87;RADIX_0000000000131137;Your Moon in Sagittarius;"The Moon in Sagittarius makes you want to take on important goals and explore the meaning of your human existence. Your higher principles bring you to search for a religion that is right for you. It could be that the search is more important to you than reaching the goal, nothing appeals to you more than an adventure. You love the feeling of being able to let go at any time and will not enter a binding relationship until later in life. The world is a challenge for you; explore it. You love your spiritual freedom above all else and hate nothing more than fanaticism and dogmatic rules. You go through life confidently and are anxious to see whatever the future has in store for you.



If you have not yet found inner harmony because your parents placed too many restrictions on you or if they simply were not available, it may be difficult for you to act tolerantly towards others who have a different opinion. You have the tendency to waste time fantasizing about the future instead of working on solving the problems facing you here and now. Your responsible nature will help you get your feet back on the ground during this lifetime."
88;RADIX_0000000000147521;Your Moon in Capricorn;In the sign Capricorn the moon is in its exile, for this reason it will not be easy for you to get emotional satisfaction. You do not like to share your feelings, perhaps out of fear of getting hurt. You appear to be cool and unfeeling although you need more security and support, more than others would. In the worst case, constant frustration or even depression could result, turning your heart into shambles. If you could learn to open yourself up even a little bit and accept your own weaknesses it would be a help to you. Instead, you are discontented and bitch at everyone, which is no wonder considering your loveless childhood. Probably you were forced to grow up and accept responsibility at an early age and were never able to live out your play instinct or experiment in a secure environment. Now you do not take any risks with unpredictable human emotions, but suppress them as well as you can. You are very careful, take everything seriously and lose yourself in solitude. You should try to contact your innermost self and develop an interest in other people. Recognize your own value, then your sense of worth will attract others who will show their affection for you.
89;RADIX_0000000000163905;Your Moon in Aquarius;"The Moon can feel a little uneasy in Aquarius because it tends to be a little impersonal. As an air sign, Aquarius is more concerned with intellectual ideals than with warmth and feelings. You may try to satisfy your need for love and security in a larger group of people instead a deeper relationship with a single person. Do not exaggerate your participation in various activities, it could merely be a diversion you designed to protect yourself from letting people to get too close. You are probably afraid that friendship might result in giving up your freedom or having to make compromises.



In spite of this you never lose interest in getting to know people and exchanging ideas with them. You set high standards for friendship for yourself and are able to demonstrate extraordinary solidarity with your friends. In your attempt to melt into a group and sacrifice yourself for a higher cause, you will probably find that you rise above the rest. This realization will soon make you proud. During your childhood you were probably intellectually stimulated by humanitarian ideals. You were allowed to show your individuality although on the other hand you had to share your parents with a lot of other people and rarely had the feeling that they were there for you."
90;RADIX_0000000000180289;Your Moon in Pisces;"The Moon feels very much at home in Pisces, because its qualities can be well expressed here. You will more likely have to watch out that you are not driven by your feelings alone that can have bad consequences. You have an active imagination and no fear of showing your emotions and opening up to others. Sometimes you revel too long in a dream state forgetting the reality. You are sensitive, honest and understanding, but not always live responsibly. You can get so involved in the problems of others that your own disappear, forgotten, into the background. Your capacity to take on other people's problems is so great that you should practice maintaining a distance in order to prevent losing yourself. You can be happy artistically channeling your imagination and inspiration without obscuring your vision of the reality around you. Allow yourself enough selfishness to say 'no' on occasion.



If your mother personified Pisces characteristics and sacrificed herself to take care of you, she encouraged the development of your sensitivity. Seen negatively she may have been trying to protect you from the problems of the cold cruel world and that softened you."
91;RADIX_0000000000524354;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Mercury;"This conjunction symbolizes the bridge between your subconscious and your practical activities. You recognize analytically the extent to which your emotional state effects your behavior towards others. The experiences you make in your everyday life leave you deeply touched. Sometimes you face difficult consequences that have long-term effects on your life. Under some circumstances your reason could be subjected by your emotions although logic warns you of this danger. Maybe you should not react so sensitively to the critical remarks of others.



Your private life and your family are extremely important to you and you devote yourself increasingly to the areas of life centered on nutrition and health. You want to practice healthful nutrition based on the latest findings and you invest a lot of effort in researching studies on the subject."
92;RADIX_0000000000786498;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Venus;People tend to like you. This alleviates your inhibitions about meeting people. You love the pleasant things in life and are happy when everything runs harmoniously. Do not neglect the development of your artistic talent, even if you were placed under heavy demands in your childhood. Sensitivity and remarkable feeling for tact contribute to your reputation for friendliness. Probably you find relations to the opposite sex fulfilling. Because of your ability to understand all sides of an issue, you are often asked to serve as a mediator. People consider you to be generous, but this brings with it the danger of being deceived or used because you cannot say no. Be aware that no one can completely avoid conflicts because they are a normal part of life.
93;RADIX_0000000001048642;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Mars;"You are probably subjected to mood swings that can at their worst be expressed in violent temper tantrums. Even if you have thrown enough fits during your lifetime, try to understand these energies and find a way to put them to constructive use so they will stop making your life difficult. Otherwise your frustrating experiences will put you in an awful mood and prevent you from attaining your goals. In relations to the opposite sex you may be inclined to jealousy if you do not watch out.



If you let things go too much, it could become dangerous for you because your activities will have no reasonable basis. It could be that you are completely lacking in sensitivity. Work on your self-control because only when you work for a cause boldly and with determination you will achieve anything that will give you cause to lean back in your armchair completely satisfied."
94;RADIX_0000000001310786;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Jupiter;"Because you want to show loyalty to others, you are sensitive and considerate. If you work on social projects it is with the goal of working towards social justice and within projects which enjoy broad support. On the other hand, your love of comfort and luxury could damage your reputation in this respect. ""Everything in moderation"" should be your motto. This is why you should not work up your emotions to the point where you see tragedy or immortal love everywhere you look.



Your constitution is resistant and can tackle illnesses before they get started. This is practical because you take on large assignments. Although Jupiter is a lover of travel, you prefer to stay at home on your couch resting on a pillow and not leave your loved ones behind."
95;RADIX_0000000001572930;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Saturn;"As a sensitive person, you are bound to have problems with your own emotional state. Sometimes you give the impression that you define yourself exclusively by your possessions and that you take the memories associated with these far too seriously. You should concentrate on the present and immediate obligations. Do not constantly revert to events which are actually long forgotten, or people could get the idea that you are the type to bear grudges.



Sometimes you seem depressed. If this should be true and if it remains over a long period of time, it would be advisable to get involved in activities in which you are able to have more fun. On the other hand you should have an ample rational faculty and are able to maintain emotions for a long time. The dominant qualities can be determined by the house positions of the Moon and Saturn as well as their aspects with other planets."
96;RADIX_0000000001835074;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Uranus;"You are a conspicuous person and show your feelings spontaneously. These feelings may not be very long lived, but earn you appreciation for honesty. No matter where you are there is always something going on because you make sure there is action. The past hardly concerns you at all, because it is much more interesting to paint the future in bright colors. Your imagination conjures up some unusual ideas, although if you are not interested in whether they will ever be realized or not. Endurance is not one of your strong points, you let yourself be distracted much too easily. Your childlike curiosity leads you to wonderful adventures, which you should be able to survive without too much injury.



It could possibly be good for you to take on some responsibility once in a while and to reign in your compulsion to be free. If you are subject to frequent fluctuations in your mood, do something about it. Generally, you should not have very serious problems, mostly because you have friends you can rely on."
97;RADIX_0000000002097218;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Neptune;"You are a very sensitive person and are not lacking creative ideas. On the other hand, you are easily influenced, which gives others opportunity to make use of your abilities for their purposes and to cheat you.



You tune into the moods of the people around you intuitively and are known for your sympathy. Still, your openness makes you vulnerable. For this reason, you should choose the people you trust very carefully. You may have psychic abilities. Whether they are useful or are merely products of your imagination depends entirely on whether you have developed an adequate sense of reality. You should not withdraw into your dream world to revel in emotions or you will risk losing contact to reality. Devote yourself instead to nurturing your artistic and musical talents, you could use your imagination for phenomenal self-expression."
98;RADIX_0000000002359362;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Pluto;"Having an emotional state that is subject to sudden and intense shifts causes you to act defiantly on occasion and try to exercise control. Your will power is strong enough to let you influence others, but avoid using it for your personal advantage. If you take a look at Astrology or other esoteric fields, you will recognize that there are goals that serve the well being of humanity, and are therefore worthwhile pursuing.



Your greatest strength is your ability to start again from scratch. Having made peace with the past, you can concentrate your attention completely on the present without the slightest fear of taking risks. This is because you know that this is the most effective way to expand your horizons.

Your early awakening may have been traumatic, or maybe you moved a few times. Watch out that you do not put people under pressure by trying to dominate them, this will only end in rejection.

Having come to terms with life you can look calmly into the future. The feeling of emotional security has great significance for you.

Women will play an important role in your life, probably because you can come to trust them easier than men."
100;RADIX_0000000009175106;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"You are making things difficult for yourself, because you prefer to revel in the past than to face the present. This is a specific karmic aspect, because the Moon, which is associated with the past, forms a conjunction with the southern Moon Node and thus tells us what we have to let go of. The message is clear: Let go and do not turn back.



Your emotions mislead you and spoil your plans. It would be better to proceed in a sober manner and put your logic to work until you have developed more emotional security. Otherwise, you will have to deal with family conflicts that will overwhelm you and may effect your metabolism."
101;RADIX_0000000009437250;Your Moon in Conjunction with Your MC;"Maybe you will reach a public position that will bring you into contact with a lot of people, whereby you will often call on the resources of the women around you; whether you are male or female. Professionally you may deal with the structuring of households. It is also possible that you are drawn to acting. If the rest of your chart is not negatively influenced in this area, you will usually leave a positive impression on others."
102;RADIX_0000000000540738;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Mercury;"Often you find yourself thrown off balance and have difficulty expressing the cause of your dissatisfaction to others in a way they can understand. Your emotional state can turn somersaults, making it difficult for you to keep the necessary distance to your problems. Even your thoughts can fall under too strong influence from your emotions, so that you will not be able to analyze crises and find a way out. 



Possibly you live according to out-of-date traditions which prevent you from getting closer to people who have a different outlook on life. The people who choose to stay in your immediate vicinity have to take a lot because you tend to release your mood swings out on them. It would be better for everyone if you concentrated your energies on constructive pursuits. Do not waste your time on self-pity, even if sentimentality does keep you from developing rational thought structures. It may be a strain on others to have to listen to longwinded and superficial stories about your private affairs; they may even be driven away. Try to take life a little easier and do not worry so much."
103;RADIX_0000000000802882;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Venus;"Possibly you lack a sense of responsibility, which is why you are inclined to sympathize with people you hardly know and invite others to abuse your trust and be harmful to your partnership.



Because you are extremely sensitive and often do not feel like yourself you should guard against unrestrained intake of a culinary nature, which is intended to serve as compensation. In the course of your life, you may have acquired unhealthy eating habits and especially eat too many sweets. It is true that you are searching for harmony, however, as long as you have not made peace with yourself, you will remain unsuccessful.



Your parents may have been too strict and could not tolerate warmth; this is evident in your reluctance to share your emotions with others. To get a grip on your dissatisfaction, take a closer look at your childhood. This will probably give you the key to your current emotional state. 



Free yourself from the influences of other people and live independently, this will present you with plenty of occasions to learn responsibility; but first you will have to overcome your laziness."
104;RADIX_0000000001065026;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Mars;"On an emotional level you are indecisive. Watch that little disappointments do not cause you to completely lose control and explode. It could eventually disturb your friendships and jeopardize your social status. A minimum willingness to compromise never hurts anyone, which you should take to heart. Possibly conflicts between you and your parents marred your childhood which may continue on in relationships and may cause you to try to avoid getting into any long-term responsibilities.



Humor is when you laugh anyway! You should hang this saying on your wall because a dose of laughter would help you develop better composure. If you could get a handle on your compulsiveness your efforts will be more constructive and your favorite vice, throwing money out the window, would come to an end."
105;RADIX_0000000001327170;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Jupiter;You have to resist your frequent attacks of spontaneous generosity, which do not necessarily serve the purpose they were intended to. Decisions are seldom rational, although it makes sense to do or not to do certain things. Actually it is nice to be able to make decisions without pondering long, but it is essential to have internalized at least the basics of moral behavior. If that does not work, you probably have difficulties relating to people because you either let yourself be cheated or you brag about abilities you do not actually have. Maybe you will find a job where you can help people in difficult situations. If you do not become too apathetic about taking care of your own every day obligations, you will achieve routine and order with time. Reasonable eating behavior would be a great advantage to you.
106;RADIX_0000000001589314;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Saturn;"If other factors in your horoscope do not provide you with balance, you will have a pessimistic outlook on life and appear cold. Your relationship to your parents could be or was intense because the Moon represents the mother whereas the father is associated with Saturn. Do not let your feelings be too fixed on the past. Bitter memories can make it impossible to achieve satisfaction here and now. However, such situations can be overcome even if you make a depressive or aggressive impression on others, who consider long and hard encounters with you should still have a place on their agenda. If you continue to isolate yourself, you will eventually find yourself in a dead end street that will be difficult to get out of. 



It is imperative that you let go of your past. It never did anyone any good to concentrate on digging up memories to the point of losing sight of the positive aspects of the present. If you take this advice, you could develop an image of yourself that will allow you to be seen with others."
107;RADIX_0000000001851458;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Uranus;"Your emotional state can show hopelessly obstinate characteristics, whose frequent mood swings can throw people off. Possibly you confuse others with your irresponsibility and indecisiveness and then feel isolated when people keep their distance.



When it comes to new friendships you are not picky, and often they do not last very long. This could be due to a restless childhood, in which you may have moved from one place to another and often changed your caregiver. Your love of adventure consumes a lot of time and energy and also distracts you from your obligations. This may cause some of the people you love to leave you suddenly. Hopefully it will not be too late when the fine day arrives when you return home and finally decide that you no longer want to be alone. It would be a great help to you if you were to develop some continuity in your behavior and maybe even tame your obsession with freedom."
108;RADIX_0000000002113602;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Neptune;"You are in a position to transfer your inner restlessness to everyone and everything around you. In this manner your many visions can create confusion, it could even reach the point where your perception of your own personal situation becomes distorted. Watch out that you do not let yourself go too much or you will work yourself up into emotional chaos. The tendency for people who want to flee reality is rising, which is why you should be careful to limit your intake of drugs or alcohol. Also avoid questionable money transactions. As an alternative to drugs, make use of your psychic abilities, even if there is a danger that your ambitions are illusory. Once you have recognized and understood the potential for difficulties in your life, you should be capable of expressing yourself creatively.



The process of decision making is generally left to your subconscious. This is why you are often uncertain whether you should look for the root of your problems within yourself or in others, such as others may try to monopolize your energy for their interests leaving you feeling used. Make an honest effort to further develop your talents and bring stability into your life. This will enable you to set your own goals independently from others who may not be acting in your best interest."
109;RADIX_0000000002375746;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Pluto;"Dominating your family and friends and tyrannizing through rotten moods are some of your favorite behavior patterns. You are often so temperamental that people are afraid of you. If you should be remembered in someone's last will, it could bring about a family conflict.



You have a natural resentment against every form of authority and hate to follow orders, which is probably why you will have trouble at work and in dealing with people in general. When making decisions you should not necessarily listen to your feelings, because they are simply too intense and are unjustified. Try to respect the feelings and free will of others. If you do not watch out, you could turn into an ill-tempered person whom it is difficult to get along with."

111;RADIX_0000000009191490;Your Moon in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"When the Moon forms an opposing aspect to the Ascendant, it is also conjunct with the Descendant. Possibly you will try to meddle in other people's lives, which will not always be greeted with enthusiasm. Because the Moon is connected to the subconscious within, it is important for you to develop a realistic self-image which will free you from illusions in relationships, whether romantic or not. If you are successful, you will be in a position to maintain a large circle of friends who appreciate your sensitive nature.



Because you enjoy socializing, the field of public relations may appeal to you. Being a people person, you have probably acquired certain social skills in the course of your life."
112;RADIX_0000000009453634;Your Moon in Opposition with Your MC;"Your childhood was not easy for you. Maybe you felt emotionally isolated and your relations to your parents were not what you had hoped for. This may have had an effect on your youth and on your grades in school. If this extends to your professional life will depend on how well you have worked through your emotional problems. Because the Moon is associated with your subconscious, it is important to gain an understanding of which kind of behavior gets you into trouble; sometimes you are not sure.

114;RADIX_0000000000819266;Your Moon in Square with Your Venus;"Be wary of financial tightrope acts, which could cause problems with others. Possibly you lack a sense of responsibility which may result in your sympathizing with people you hardly know and may act as an invitation for others to abuse your trust. This may also effect your intimate relationships and may be harmful to your partnership. Your parents may have been too strict and unable to tolerate warmth; this is evident in your reluctance to share your emotions with others. To get a grip on your dissatisfaction, take a closer look at your childhood. This will probably give you the key to your current emotional state. Often you let others influence you, even when it is detrimental to you and contrary to your interests. Become independent of the help of others and learn to live independently, this will open up many possibilities for your life."
115;RADIX_0000000001081410;Your Moon in Square with Your Mars;"Do not let your character deteriorate into a state of emotional instability, because you become quick-tempered, which is not an acceptable base for building and maintaining satisfying relationships. You may perceive the situation subjectively, which is precisely why a flood of anger threatens to build up. The best would be to learn to control this within the course of your lifetime.



Probably you pretend to be more independent than you are, although you insist on remaining unattached and fight every threat to your independence with tooth and nail, whereby you often create problems where none exist. It may be due to the prominence of conflicts with your parents during your early childhood, which may be having a negative effect on your character and your professional progress.



Apparently you have problems with self-discipline. If you have not made an effort to incorporate sufficient relaxation into your life, then you need not worry if one day your stomach goes on strike, especially if you are guilty of the other extreme and have been suppressing your worries."
116;RADIX_0000000001343554;Your Moon in Square with Your Jupiter;"Be careful not to let your emotions get out of control. That will have a detrimental influence on your objective judgement and cause you to draw the wrong conclusions from your experiences, which will cause you immense difficulties. In the area of finances, you could be inclined to extreme generosity and then overlook the fact that you are being used. Do not be amazed if you find yourself running out of money on occasion.



You may love to travel but have trouble choosing a destination. Otherwise you have bad eating habits, which you notice every time you stand on the bathroom scale. Problems with your basic convictions may stem from the differences in religious and moral views between you and your parents that reach back into your childhood. Work on acquiring a more reserved attitude to questions of faith."

Steadfastness is not your strong point and activities that always have the same routine will not arouse your enthusiasm. Wait and see if life offers you opportunity to channel your interests in other activities. Probably you will have to be free to do your own thing, before you can stop complaining about the present conditions.



The material situation of your childhood and youth will not have left you with a feeling of stability, maybe you moved from place to place. This might also have resulted in a lack of satisfying friendships because you are always in search of unusual events. A compelling desire for social renewal finds expression in your moving orations on this topic."
119;RADIX_0000000002129986;Your Moon in Square with Your Neptune;"Do not let yourself get confused by your many visions. It could get to the point where you are not able to perceive your personal situation realistically. Watch out that you do not let yourself go to the extent where you work yourself up into emotional chaos. Also stay away from consciousness-altering substances like alcohol and similar drugs, resist the temptation to leave reality behind even for a short time. As an alternative, make use of your psychic abilities, even if there is a danger that your ambitions are illusory. It could be difficult for you to lead a stable, independent life, but invest all your energy into it.



Possibly you are due to inherit a large estate, which will relieve you of your responsibility to earn your own way through life. This would be a shame because you could put your ability to recognize problem areas to good use in a creative profession."
120;RADIX_0000000002392130;Your Moon in Square with Your Pluto;"Possibly you do not find your relationship to your parents very satisfying and have been through a lot of conflicts with them. This may account for your lack of trust and your inability to open yourself up emotionally to anyone. Even if you still prevent any interference with your life, you should try to talk to your parents about the earlier problems, especially with your mother. Try to get your hot temper under control, get a better grip on your life and do not let your feelings guide you in every decision; they can be deceiving. Although you want to let go of the past, you should not make the mistake of avoiding every kind of commitment.



With this aspect you should have some kind of psychic power, which makes you reject everything worldly. Insignificant details annoy you, because you want to devote yourself exclusively to important affairs. If you could be a little more patient, you would find that everything would go a lot easier."
121;RADIX_0000000008421442;Your Moon in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;"You often do not feel in tune with yourself and personal defeats rob you of your will to continue. Your problem is that you cannot trust your feelings because you are easily impressed and then bitterly disappointed when you find that you were deceived. Adverse effects on your health could be the consequences.



It would be helpful if you were to construct a secure emotional basis from which to live. Look deep within yourself to find out what is really important to you. Always use reason first, to avoid overreacting to distress by doing things which you will regret later. Your ambition should be to live in harmony with all your emotions and instincts so that you can let go of the past and finally allow new horizons to open to you.



As a man with this aspect in your chart, it will be women who teach you the most painful lessons."

When you invite people over for a meal, they are especially pleased because your apartment is beautifully decorated. Possibly you have an excellent singing voice because your Venus is linked to the sign Taurus, where the moon is exalted and it corresponds physically to the throat.
126;RADIX_0000000001097794;Your Moon in Trine with Your Mars;"You need a certain amount of emotional suspense and have a great physical and psychic energy reservoir.

You do not expect people to be perfect and you are quick to forgive mistakes. However you insist on admitting discrepancies."
127;RADIX_0000000001359938;Your Moon in Trine with Your Jupiter;"A need to become active to help others leads you often to proceed selflessly and do everything in your power.

Possibly you may inherit some day, although you are in a position to take care of all your material needs.



You are experienced in many fields and are able to follow the essence of conversations. You take care of the affairs of the area in which you live and, should you run for mayor, it will not be an unpleasant duty for you. You favor people who are open and honest and whose words are followed by actions. Harmonious living situations are very important to you as you prefer the company of people who are able to shake off the stress of every day life and who do not plan to integrate stress into their leisure activities. You are true to your partner and will remain loyal in every situation."
128;RADIX_0000000001622082;Your Moon in Trine with Your Saturn;Your consideration and honesty comes from a traditional outlook on life. You think rationally and pragmatically and have a good grip on your private life. Your circle of friends is small but of high quality. If you should ever bring a child into the world, you will appear relatively authoritarian, although you only have the best interests of your child at heart. Your intelligence and experience with social affairs let people rely on you when it comes to organizing and carrying out larger projects. If overtime should be necessary in this context, you will take it on without complaining.

The danger here, as with all positive aspects, is becoming sluggish and not realizing your potential.



If you have started a family, you will try to make your children aware of the sensitive side of the world and present them with opportunities to develop their creative potential.

Your financial records always satisfy the bank.

You have a good eye for the opportunities which life presents and instinctively use them to your advantage. With your magnetic attraction you add life to your surroundings.

As far as health is concerned, there should be no major problems, as long as other factors in your chart do not contradict this aspect.



You are sympathetic to the needs of other people. All your obligations are taken care of brilliantly and you are always open to new ideas for making your life and the lives of others easier. Taking part in the structuring of your environment makes you feel like a responsible member of society. Probably you could spontaneously make a number of sensible suggestions for getting a grip on some of the world problems."
143;RADIX_0000000008454210;Your Moon in Sextile with Your Northern Moon Node;"Your mental state is relatively stable. People appreciate your quiet, serene nature. You live by your feelings and should continue to do so. Once in a while you could trust your intuition more.

Men who have this harmonious aspect in their chart, will frequently receive the support of women during their lives. Generally this constellation tells of a more feminine nature."
144;RADIX_0000000009240642;Your Moon in Sextile with Your Ascendant;"With your sensitivity you can sometimes have a difficult life, although it may also help you to understand your life in all of its variations.

145;RADIX_0000000009502786;Your Moon in Sextile with Your MC;This sextile indicates a harmonious childhood. The behavior of the individual members of the family toward each other and others should be characterized by mutual consideration, so that it should not be difficult for you to maintain personal discipline in all areas, but especially at work. You get along well with your colleagues and your boss, because you are known for your reliability and are entrusted with important projects.
146;RADIX_0000000000000070;Your Moon in the First House;"Lunar energies influence you more than other people, so much more so that it will be noticeable to others. The essence of your being is characterized by your strong intuition and deep feelings. If the Moon is free from challenging aspects you should be sensitive and open to impulses from your surroundings. Sometimes your way of approaching things is somewhat naive, but your intuitive intelligence lets you do the right thing at the right time. You can recognize opportunity and your extraordinary ability to feel and respond to vibrations lets you know when it is better to hold back.



The Moon as the principle of conception and motherhood expresses itself in the first house by a desire to melt into the surroundings. This makes it necessary to counter by choosing to remain distant. It is important to you not to concentrate your energies on reacting to your environment out of fear of being alone, but to clearly define yourself and become an independent individual. Do not believe that simply by screaming loud enough someone will come running to fulfill your wishes. You should have already reached a point where you learned to sort out and interpret impulses from others. All in all, the Moon in the first house presents you with the task of maturing and overcoming childish behavior.



Be careful not to be too subjective and use your analytical reason. You can get so caught up in what is happening to you, your emotions, and hang-ups that you are incapable of perceiving life and those around you objectively. For this reason humanistic Astrology calls the first house, the test of isolation. The way out is to learn to give and take."
147;RADIX_0000000000016454;Your Moon in the Second House;"The Moon in the second house is not responsible for increasing material wealth, but concerns itself with emotional stability or the resulting instability. This gives you an emotional relationship to the physical world.



The Moon induces taking in and accepting, which leaves you with the tendency to believe everything you hear. Your family may have influenced you in this respect. Maybe you are known for your sentimentality in identifying with memorabilia and your inability to separate useful artifacts from useless junk. Your fascination for family heirlooms, antiques as well as for all sorts of mementos could expand because the Moon also establishes a link to the past.



In addition, the Moon is the fastest moving body in the heavens. This can be expressed in the second house by fluctuating economics.



You probably work in a profession that has some relation to the Moon, for example in public service, nutrition, education or something related to real estate. Your colleagues appreciate your flexibility and the way you respond sensitively to the needs of all your co-workers."
148;RADIX_0000000000032838;Your Moon in the Third House;"You are so receptive to the thoughts of the people around you that you have had difficulties distinguishing between your own convictions and the ones you hear from others. It is also difficult for you to maintain distance in some situations and to discipline your rational thought processes because you spontaneously react emotionally. Everyone agrees that you let yourself be swayed by emotion. It would be best for you to concede, accepting your way of dealing with reality. Your feelings determine how you are going to perceive a given situation. Your moods can be as inconsistent as the phases of the moon. The positive aspect of this is that you can relate to nearly everyone you talk to on a personal level and express your sympathy sincerely.



You are very imaginative and have a phenomenal memory. If you approach a science such as archeology or ancient history you should be prepared to stick with it even if you let yourself be distracted and give up easily.



When communicating you express your emotions with every utterance. You could probably write expressive poetry or heart-wrenching stories. In any case, people will love to listen to you once you get your stories structured.



The relationships to your siblings are probably very important to you. Especially your female relations will have influenced you, because you felt safe with them and experienced compassion which you were then able to pass on to your brothers and sisters."
149;RADIX_0000000000049222;Your Moon in the Fourth House;"The fourth house is the Moon's natural home. This explains why you cherish your family as a source of peace and security. You want to be sheltered and cannot understand how some people are impatient to free themselves from the constraints of their parent's home.



You will remember where you came from your whole life and your parents will always play an important role in your life. You are looking for harmony that is seldom found in the world. If you got little attention or were never sure of your parent's trust, it will have more devastating effect on the course of your life than it would for others. You will be more determined to start a family and provide the emotional security that you were denied. Unfortunately, it is a difficult problem to solve because in such a situation it is all too easy to repeat our parents' mistakes.



You have an especially close relationship to your mother, which you should loosen a little if you want to avoid neglecting your own family. It is important for you to achieve independence and toughen yourself up for life out in the world.



It is possible that you may start a long and drawn out search for a place where you would like to settle down. You may find peace near a body of water."
150;RADIX_0000000000065606;Your Moon in the Fifth House;"With the Moon in the fifth house you are looking for companionship, protection and recuperation in your romantic relationships and are content once you have found it. Your creative endeavors are unrestrained in a way which few can accomplish. You should encourage this talent in yourself; the resulting feeling of individuality makes you pleased and content because you do not have to fight for it. The people around you would love to finally come into contact with you.



You probably want to have children. The moon stands for motherhood which everyone wants to experience in her own way, independently of its house position. It is important to remember that raising children is an invitation to repeat the mistakes of your parents or to fall into the opposite extreme. The fifth house represents the child in us. Because the Moon keeps the past alive, you could be harboring the same feelings for your children that your parents held for you. This problem can surface in a romantic relationship as well.



You are like a magnet to the people around you; meeting people is spontaneous and natural. Use your creative potential and your playful nature for art and music."
151;RADIX_0000000000081990;Your Moon in the Sixth House;"With this Moon position you will have fun organizing your daily routines. Repetitious activities, like preparing meals, give you a sense of satisfaction and constancy. The sixth house concerns itself with health and with prophylactic measures to stay healthy. This explains why you are sensitive to signals from your body. It may go so far as to cause physical sensations upon entering a new situation or when meeting new people. You have a special talent to transform these perceptions into useful information. Your health and fitness depend on whether your mood swings hinder your capacity to organize your daily affairs.



The Moon's aspects in this house will tell how you go about solving your everyday problems. There may be a relation to how your mother managed her daily chores. Pay attention to diseases that occur often in your family. Watch what you eat and drink, you have a tendency to compensate for emotional conflicts by uncontrolled consumption. For you it is especially important to live in harmony with your physical needs.



You want to include your emotions in your professional life. You would rather prefer to work in a field with people every day, than standing alone in a laboratory. Your colleagues will not overlook your emotional nature, but you should guard against prying too deeply into their personal lives."
152;RADIX_0000000000098374;Your Moon in the Seventh House;"The Moon in the seventh house increases your sensitivity allowing you to adapt to your partner's needs. It may become a problem if you try to conform to their perceptions and get it all wrong.



Take a closer look at your relationship to see if you are not actually looking for your mother; the Moon represents the mother. You may catch yourself repeating childlike behavior in your relationship and can then see the problem in a more realistic context. Do not let yourself be molded into a mother role and avoid doing the same to your lover. The goal should be self-reliance and independence. In spite of this, you naturally crave for a stable relationship and the feeling of security and participation.



The ever-changing nature of the Moon can express itself in your quiet moments in which you sense a deep conflict between your individuality and your desire to melt with your lover. This can annoy you and cause you to question the relationship."
153;RADIX_0000000000114758;Your Moon in the Eighth House;"The eighth house is devoted to the occult and spiritual topics. With the Moon in this house, you are naturally open to the hidden powers of the universe, which come into play in your personal life or in the open. On the other hand, economic factors are brought up, for example other people's material resources. You may have the ability to foresee societal and economic developments.



As a child you were probably receptive to signals and nonverbal communication, especially to your mother's subliminal emotions. You should liberate yourself from these feelings, if you have not already done so. Make sure to guard your current relationships from this kind of complication. If you want to definitively solve these problems, do not go digging up your past.



You probably started thinking about death and sexuality in your childhood, which had a strong influence on your character. Your primary requirement in a relationship is a dependable compensation for your daily battles. You can be very generous and sympathetic to your partner. These capacities are not only helpful in romance but also in dealing with people in other situations.



If the Moon receives challenging aspects in the eighth house, the end of your relationship could take a dramatic turn. Do not forget that a collapse is always unpleasant at first and causes a lot of pain, but that these crises allow us to grow."
154;RADIX_0000000000131142;Your Moon in the Ninth House;"The Moon in the ninth house makes your emotions an inroad to the world of philosophy and ethics. Intuitively, you sense the spirit of the age guiding morality and can even foresee future events. You can interpret symbols or old ornaments with understanding and imagination. Even if your rational thoughts do not get you anywhere, you are able to feel the solution and rely on your instinct. You will take on your family values, but do not be timid about questioning these values from time to time and reforming them when necessary.



If you should feel a strong urge to live in a foreign country for a while, you should go for it. The Moon in the ninth house will provide you with ample opportunity. When you have finally gotten on your way it was probably due to a strongly emotional decision or from fantasizing about foreign cultures. Be careful that you do not use travel, dreams, or the occult as an escape from reality. Meditation in a Buddhist monastery may not remove all of your worries.



The nurturing principle of the Moon expresses itself in your capacity to share your knowledge with others. Beware of seeing yourself as a guru, who inspires his followers and gives them insights and hope, but does not place enough emphasis on maintaining self-reliance.



People of the male persuasion may have a special fascination for foreign women, or be drawn to women from whom they can learn a lot without having to submit to matriarchal structures. You will never willingly give up your freedom."
155;RADIX_0000000000147526;Your Moon in the Tenth House;"Since the Moon in your chart is in the tenth house, you probably adored your father above everything. The trained eye will not overlook that your facial expressions and gestures are similar to your fathers. As a child you were dependent on his affection and may be susceptible to sacrificing your ambitions to care for him. Certainly, this is nothing terrible, but you should eventually distance yourself from your father in order to lead an independent life.



You have been taught to believe that feeling secure is dependent on what you do for a living. Furthermore, you will make sure that you are respected by those around you, because within you there is a small child craving love and attention. Challenging aspects from other planets to the Moon in the tenth house could call attention to other aspects of your personality, which reinforce the desire for approval.



You are able to perceive communal vibrations, so that the emotions of large gatherings of people can manipulate you. You may choose a profession in which you need the tender, beneficent Moon qualities to care for people. In any case, you will always remain true to your profession."
156;RADIX_0000000000163910;Your Moon in the Eleventh House;"With the Moon in the eleventh house you fulfill your need for security and protection in activities with groups of volunteers. You like the feeling of being a part of a group, an organization or a circle of friends. You should be careful which groups you join because you are inclined to be too open and be too uncritical of your friends.



You like to take care of your friends and also expect to be taken care of on occasion. You have managed to maintain some friendships since childhood or adolescence. Try to remember if they involved frustrations, which may have resulted in the development of strategic behavior that may disturb your interaction today.



You use your free time to tank up on energy and receive emotional approval outside the family and the office. You especially like to help out with charity work and feel at home with the organizations. You need to feel that you are reaching a lot of people with your activities and therefore are prepared to sacrifice.



If the Moon receives challenging aspects in the eleventh house, you could have problems with relations to women. The cause may be unresolved conflicts with your mother, which resurface with your female friends. On the other hand a Moon with harmonious aspects points to friendly relations with your mother which allows you to get along well with women.



Pay attention to two things: Do not let mood swings cause you to change your life ambitions too quickly and listen carefully for signals about your own personal needs and do not ignore them."
157;RADIX_0000000000180294;Your Moon in the Twelfth House;"This Moon position gives you a reputation for being mysterious and exotic. Your sensitivity enables you to absorb the atmosphere, causing your feelings to flow into those of the people near to you. Dreams and visions play a large role in your life. Reality may slip by you unnoticed on occasion leaving the impression that you are not all there. Unfortunately you are easily influenced. Your challenge is to use your sensitivity wisely without opening yourself and becoming too vulnerable. It may help you to withdraw from outside influences and take time for introspection. You could also confide in a friend. This may help since you take in a lot but seldom express yourself clearly.



You may have an intensive but unconventional relationship to your mother. As a child you were emotionally attached to her and still are in a way, even though you are becoming increasingly independent. Your dreams may tell you more about the bond you had with your mother even after her death.



This Moon position endows you with the capacity of compassion for the downtrodden. You may choose a profession that takes you to places where you have the opportunity to help the socially disadvantaged.



In spite of your sincerity, you have your secrets, which you share with no one. It may be a romance that is not supposed to be discovered. In any case it makes you even more interesting."
158;RADIX_0000000000000132;Mercury - The Mental Expression;"From the Earth, the planet Mercury seems to travel about as fast as the Sun. This is an illusion. Mercury orbits around the Sun in approximately 88 days. Its distance from the Sun is 59 million kilometers. With its diameter of 4840 kilometers it is smaller than the Earth. Mercury can be either a morning or an evening star. In a horoscope, it can be at most 28 degrees away from the Sun, so that the only possible aspect to the Sun for Mercury is a conjunction.



In Mythology, Mercury or Hermes served as a messenger to the gods, responsible for conveying news. His intelligence and his silver tongue allowed him to become the god of commerce. He enjoyed cheating others so much that thieves and other ""riffraff"" honor him as a god. In Astrology he represents our ability to communicate, analytical reason, business sense, common sense and wit. As morning star it is associated with the sign Gemini, as evening star with Virgo."
159;RADIX_0000000000000129;Your Mercury in Aries;"When making decisions you demonstrate confidence and do not hesitate to play all the possibilities through mentally. You know what you want and take on work with determination. You do not like it when others try to hold you back; you would rather take risks. Discussions and even arguments draw your interest, because you have an appreciation for speaking clear and directly and do not believe in talking around issues. You are quick to grasp the essence of the discussion and you know how to reply immediately when criticized. You should take more time to weigh the opinions of others as a counter to your willfulness. You can force others out of the way without even realizing it.



Sometimes you react in a hectic manner and are impatient when something gets in your way. Learn to cooperate and to make compromises if you want to be more successful."
160;RADIX_0000000000016513;Your Mercury in Taurus;"You are a practical person with both feet planted firmly on the ground. You do not waste time on far-flung unrealistic ideas because you insist on tangible results. You try to avoid risks and think things over carefully before taking any steps. If someone wants to change your mind, they have to be prepared to provide a lot of hard facts. On the other hand, others know they can rely on your explanations. You can probably handle money well. Your bank account is sure to profit from your enterprising nature.



You have practical, realistic ideas and think through all the consequences. You do not let yourself be distracted but are able to concentrate and rely on your power of reason."
161;RADIX_0000000000032897;Your Mercury in Gemini;"Mercury feels at home in the sign of Gemini, where it rules. You are capable of intellectual accomplishments and can express yourself well. You approach problems without bias and with the necessary distance. It is easy for you to convince others of your views, because you address their reservations and are willing to discuss every aspect. You do not try to dodge issues but defend a firm position.



Learning is easy for you, you are curious to know more and want to be always up to date. Your education is very important to you. If your expectations are not fulfilled, you take action to remedy the deficit. You harbor ambitions of becoming a great scientist. You are well informed about what is going on in the society around you and do not let yourself be outwitted. You can see through deception. When you get your curiosity under control and grant your nerves a well-deserved break, your spirit in motion should be able to accomplish any task."
162;RADIX_0000000000049281;Your Mercury in Cancer;"It is probably as difficult for you to approach a problem without being influenced by prejudices as it is for you to remain detached. You can separate your emotions and intellect well, which prevents you from being led astray, although logical thinking is not one of your strong points. You always get emotionally involved in what you are doing. You determine the merit of an idea more by intuition than by facts. You sometimes seem to be irrational, but you instinctively find the most advantageous route. You have an incredible memory and do not tend to egotism.



You should make more of an effort to see things as they really are. Make use of your talent for empathizing with the situations of other people and do not be insulted just because someone criticizes you."
163;RADIX_0000000000065665;Your Mercury in Leo;"You enjoy expressing yourself in complex language. You feel at ease telling entertaining stories to attentive listeners. When you take on a goal, you go for it with full confidence and spirit. You are proud of your intellectual capabilities. However, try not to overdo it or you will seem conceited. Ideas that come from you usually dazzle, but you do not bother yourself with the details. Obstacles only serve to challenge you and get you really going. Try not to let your entire thoughts circle around yourself. If you proceed with a little more caution, you will find that you will be more successful.



Your greatest talent is your determination. You can set it toward helping you achieve career goals. You do not easily let yourself be convinced by others but prefer to make your own experiences."
164;RADIX_0000000000082049;Your Mercury in Virgo;You can usually rely on your power of reasoning and can use it to solve everyday problems. Your ability to analyze problems thoroughly makes you capable of planning a task well before undertaking it. You take care to express yourself correctly and expect the same from others.

You take your responsibilities seriously and like to place your intellect at the disposal of an employer who appreciates you. You are especially suited to do research, because you do not overlook the most insignificant detail and have perseverance. When you are dissatisfied, you become compulsively critical and even tear apart the successes of anyone you see as an opponent.
165;RADIX_0000000000098433;Your Mercury in Libra;"You endeavor to use your intellect to create peace and harmony in your environment. You are diplomatic and keep the interests of everyone involved in sight when you are resolving conflicts. This is why you are often called upon. You are more than willing to organize activities for creating justice. Make sure you make your own position known.



You are an honest person and crave recognition from other people. You have no difficulties handling large groups of people and do well at trade fairs, receptions and in public relations in general. You also have a knack for public performances and for art. You love to explore all the types and the various playgrounds of human relations. An evening of relaxed conversation with your friends makes you feel most at home. If you are able to carry your decisions through and learn from constructive conflicts, then Mercury in Libra will serve you well."
166;RADIX_0000000000114817;Your Mercury in Scorpio;"You use reason to discover the secrets of life. You like to dig deep and are not satisfied with superficial explanations. You have your own way of thinking, and do not let anyone peek at your cards. You prepare your strategy in secret in order to more effectively confuse your opponent. It is not easy for you to include other opinions in your decision making, but that is exactly what you should do, if you want to avoid earning a reputation as an egotist. You have a pronounced determination and fight for your point of view regardless of the risks, although compromises would be better in some cases.



You notice concealed motivations of others and easily uncover hidden details; it is not easy to deceive you. Although it would do you good to learn to take defeat constructively instead of losing yourself fantasizing about retaliation."
167;RADIX_0000000000131201;Your Mercury in Sagittarius;"You tend to lose yourself in grandiose thoughts and overlook important details. Your thoughts center on societal development, justice, morality, and philosophy. However, you can lose sight of the connotation and start building castles in the sky. Detached and abstract trains of thought are more your style than concrete, detailed analysis. You have great ambitions, the fulfillment of which depends on whether you can manage to think realistically enough. You try to recognize the connotations of societal influences and fight for everyone's freedom of opinion, although you have a tendency to present your opinion dogmatically, backhandedly dismissing the arguments of others. Guard yourself from intellectual arrogance; do not let yourself lose touch with the common people.



On the other hand, you can be extremely tolerant and respectable. As an esteemed member of society you would do anything for social development. You would do well in education or politics. You sometimes have premonitions about events of global importance, which enable you to adapt to the new developments quickly. You do not mince words but voice your opinion clearly, whereby your sarcasm sometimes hurts others."
168;RADIX_0000000000147585;Your Mercury in Capricorn;"You are ambitious and set high goals for yourself. You are likely to reach these goals through realistic and meticulous preparations.

You could reach a high position in this society and are easily impressed by status symbols and trophies. In conversation you are reasonable, it takes a long time until you give in to an emotional outburst. You are not exactly the most entertaining person, but you have plenty of other qualities. You are reliable and keep your promises. You never lose sight of reality and you can bring others down to Earth, should it be necessary. You should still try to develop your sense of humor and not take everything so seriously."
169;RADIX_0000000000163969;Your Mercury in Aquarius;"You are known for your unconventional logic and are always good for a surprise. New developments intrigue you.

You feel most at ease when you are able to express your individuality, because you are very lively.



It is your ambition to relax outdated structures and bring about more modern thinking. You know that it is high time for essential reforms. It could be that you are too demanding and expect too much from the establishment, but you definitely are on the right path. You detest deception and become furious when your environment fails to recognize the sign of the times, holding tight to tradition. You will have to develop more patience. You can approach topics easily and are not offended by criticism that was not intended personally."
170;RADIX_0000000000180353;Your Mercury in Pisces;"Mercury does not feel at ease in Pisces. The foggy atmosphere here inhibits clear thinking. You like to let your wishful thinking color your perception of reality and then make decisions that defy logic. Usually you are lead by a feeling. Success and failure depend on how well your intuition is functioning at the moment. You are aware of great passions within you, but these are usually too vague to allow concrete goals to develop. You should find an honest and reliable counselor who could get your head straight. Pay special attention to language, express yourself clearly, otherwise misunderstandings are inevitable. You do not have to interpret all the events happening around you according to their relation to yourself, some things happen which have absolutely nothing to do with you. 



If lyric and prose move you, you should definitely follow up your interest and get your thoughts down on paper. Your writing may intrigue others. You will get a better grip on your life when you start taking a hard look at reality, even if you will never be an Einstein."
171;RADIX_0000000000786562;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Venus;"With this aspect you should be able to express yourself both orally and in writing and have a lot of fun with language. People usually get along with you because you have no problems making compromises. It would be too stressful to always insist on having your way. Work in the background is easier for you than standing in the limelight. People appreciate the way you follow up your words with action. In dealing with others you are charming and diplomatic and mostly use your abilities for humanistic causes. Maybe you are a writer or work in some other area of communication. You like to spend time with others and your radiant presence makes everybody feel good. This carefree and easy life will be reflected at work, even during those phases in which you cannot make yourself comply with regular procedures. It may be better for you to break off and go into business for yourself; be confident that you can do it."
172;RADIX_0000000001048706;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Mars;"Even with your sharp intellect and mental capacity, there are some questions you cannot answer. Conflicts often arise in connection with your volunteer work for causes, which are especially important to you. This is because you often defend your opinion vehemently. This aspect is especially advantageous for work in the area of journalism and in research, because you love to stick your nose into others people's business. You say whatever you feel like saying, making it possible for you to make clear decisions and stick to them. Just do not get too impatient, or you will find yourself fighting your battles all alone.



Out of interest in politics and social affairs you are frequently found among people who love discussions and are prone to giving long speeches. You are not one to avoid disputes because wherever Mars is in the game there is competition involved. The confidence provided by your extensive knowledge makes you glad to share it with others. However, you should keep your feeling of intellectual superiority under control."
173;RADIX_0000000001310850;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Jupiter;"This aspect should expand your consciousness and arouse your interest in studies of philosophical and moral questions that will open doors to your social and professional success. Also, you can judge personal as well as social events objectively, and enthusiastically follow your projects through to their completion. Rhetorical talents enable you to convince people. At work these talents help to provide the support and cooperation of your co-workers. The primary concerns of humanity, as they are represented by Amnesty International and by environmental activists against the planetary climatic crisis, are also your concerns, which earns you respect and admiration.



An exploratory expedition out into the great wide world has long been an ambition of yours, which you should definitely realize. With some appropriate professional training, you could go into the field of tourism."
174;RADIX_0000000001572994;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Saturn;Although you are not the most witty and rhetorically trained person around, your logical way of thinking will help you take care of your private and professional obligations to everybody's satisfaction. Reason and common sense will not let you raise your voice without having considered the issues first. Your studies are comprehensive and well structured. You have the endurance to work intensively over a long period of time. A pronounced understanding of form and structure combined with your mathematical abilities makes you especially suitable for a career in architecture or engineering. On your way to realizing your intellectual ambitions, expect some difficulties and prepare to take time out for relaxation and compensation. This will combat symptoms of nervousness, as would a healthy sense of humor. Occasionally reconsidering your outlook on life should prevent you from becoming overly critical of new developments and will give you more tolerance in dealing with people.
175;RADIX_0000000001835138;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Uranus;"Just how well developed your intellectual and rhetorical abilities are is noticeable in your quick-witted and original way of thinking. You can intuitively differentiate right from wrong and usually find yourself at the right time and place to make connections that later prove to be advantageous. Still, do not let yourself get too overzealous and make a habit of setting unrealistically high goals. There is a real danger that you could suddenly change your mind and create a lot of confusion.



A deep interest in esoteric fields awakens your longing for a better understanding of the fundamental structures of life. You could probably achieve this if you devote yourself to the study of Astrology.



Mercury represents all the areas of communication, while Uranus is concerned with developments in electronics. This aspect could give you an inclination to choose a profession dealing with electronic communications, especially in light of the rapid expansion of this field in conjunction with the increasing role of computers. A never-ending search for new experiences frequently puts you in a position to present offbeat solutions that result in recognition of your colleagues and your boss."
176;RADIX_0000000002097282;Your Mercury in Conjunction with your Neptune;"Do not let your lively imagination let you get carried away, even if you are convinced that you can intuitively grasp the emotional state of the people around you. Sometimes you are quick to overshoot the boundaries. Even when you are right, try to express your thoughts clearly and use understandable language, this will prevent aggravation and misunderstandings. When dealing with the concrete demands of everyday life, you prefer alternatives to the logical approach. This causes chaos in your environment. Your interests have been oriented on mysticism and esoteric fields that may have inspired you to write.



Constant daydreaming should have an effect on your poetic, literary or other creative talents. Also photography fascinates you. In a group, you tend to embellish your narratives to the point where you are forced to avoid going into any kind of commitment. Instead of debating issues, you just do what feels right. You can be secretive which holds the danger of letting you slip away into your dream world and losing all contact with reality."
177;RADIX_0000000002359426;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Pluto;"A finely- tuned intellect enables you to get behind other people's secrets and see through to the root of the matter. Even if your behavior is sometimes extreme, you are basically objective and keep an open mind, whereby the truth is more important to you than a half-hearted compromise. Put your imaginative capacity and your willpower to use, whereby you should try to keep your tendency to want to change everybody's mind in line. 



Due to your remarkable subtlety in solving the most complex problems, you are especially suited to research, or criminology. Maybe you want to acquire the wisdom of esoteric fields, whereby you should not put yourself under pressure and should try your hand at Astrology. Once your interest has been aroused you will certainly be able to produce papers on this topic. Take care not to let your arrogance get out of hand while you are putting your proposals into practice."
178;RADIX_0000000008388738;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;"Intellect and logic will lead you in the right direction. Sometimes it seems like you receive inspiration from unknown sources. With this knowledge you can attain personal success and look towards the future with confidence. As a creature of curiosity, always wanting to know more, even if you do not have professional qualifications in the classical sense, you have a good feel for future developments and the role you are destined to play in them. Communication with others is important to you because you learn a lot of important things that way. Never remaining fixed on your own way of thinking, your flexibility lets you meet people half way. This saves you many frustrating experiences. 



The relationship between you and your brethren should be warm, which is important to you. Contact with them lets you see things a lot clearer."
179;RADIX_0000000009175170;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"With the planet Mercury on the Ascendant it would be wondrous if you did not attain a certain level of intelligence. Your talent for logical thinking impresses people. Watch out that you do not end up isolated in a world of illusion, because you tend to over-intellectualize your dealings with others. A dose of empathy for others never hurts anyone.



Even if you usually make a regal and independent impression, deep inside you feel a need to bond with people. For this reason it would do you good to allow yourself to get deeply involved with another person; otherwise you may remain lonely. Although before making this type of statement, it is necessary to consult your entire horoscope."
180;RADIX_0000000009437314;Your Mercury in Conjunction with Your MC;General education is very important to you, which is why you spend a lot of your time studying. Your boss and your colleagues are impressed with your knowledge and the originality of your thoughts. Communication is definitely your thing. A profession in communications would be a great advantage to you because you are excellent at recognizing relationships and explaining them. This is why you would be good at transmitting knowledge.
181;RADIX_0000000001065090;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Mars;"Your views may challenge others and may lead to conflicts, especially when you feel insulted, which is seldom the case. You like to run off at the mouth, although it is absolutely not necessary to antagonize people, because with your intellectual capacity, you should be able to make compromises.



Possibly, you are too skeptical and conservative in your way of thinking. Being under constant time pressure can cause you react in an oversensitive manner. In your rage, you sometimes hurt people's feelings without realizing it. Accept the fact that not everyone enjoys a confrontation as much as you do. Make more of an effort to listen to the arguments from the other side. It would be even better if you could manage to be more understanding. First of all, learn to recognize both sides of the coin and do not interpret a difference of opinion as a personal attack."
182;RADIX_0000000001327234;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Jupiter;Make more of an effort to avoid making promises that you cannot keep. It does not accomplish anything to start the day enthusiastically and then resign the minute complications start to hamper your progress. It may be that you bring ideas into the world that few other people cannot relate to. Try to get an idea of the reception before wasting energy on impractical ideas. Also, it helps to break larger tasks down into smaller steps, set realistic goals and accept the fact that although this is somewhat less exciting, it has more potential for success because it allows for a more efficient use of your limited organizational capacity. Basically, your thinking is not always realistic and your self-image could be more objective. Frequently, you exaggerate your abilities and end up feeling overburdened, which can be critical when others find out that your enthusiasm was not sincere. Be more reliable and think about the consequences before you engage in long speeches. This will increase your success and earn respect and appreciation for your efforts.
183;RADIX_0000000001589378;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Saturn;"Watch out that you do not become too skeptical of developments and take on a strong defensive stance. It would be a shame if you were to miss opportunities because you were not able to recognize the pleasant side of life. This kind of negative attitude will have an impact on your social life. That is a good reason to get up the courage to smile at your reflection instead of scoffing at it. If you can restrict your tendency to complain and be intolerant you will soon be able to take part in what is going on.



Achieving recognition for your intellectual accomplishments is often difficult because competition on all levels of the free market economy as well as the social welfare state demands unconventional strategies for success, which seem for you very difficult to come up with.



Before you sign a contract you should either seek professional advice or thoroughly investigate the details of the agreement on your own, otherwise you are likely to overlook the fine print. Also avoid agreeing too quickly, even if the agreement appears to contain advantages for you. Take care of all your affairs and keep things in order to avoid letting misunderstandings distract you from proceeding as you have chosen."
184;RADIX_0000000001851522;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Uranus;"Your intellect is constantly running on high speed, it will not be easy for you to turn off. Learn to relax and loosen up; tomorrow is another day. This can prevent your impatience from developing into a nervous state of exhaustion. Although you are an original thinker and stay mentally active, you can change your convictions suddenly and create confusion. Sometimes you are mentally removed and draw conclusions that you have not thoroughly considered. You are probably spontaneous, due to Uranus's character.



Because people spend a lot of time in groups and are dependent on social contacts, you should be careful not to insist that everyone share your views. At least you should respect other people's opinions because everyone has a right to free expression. This attitude may turn people off who find you arrogant. Finally, do not take yourself too serious and try to get your eccentric behavior under control."
185;RADIX_0000000002113666;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Neptune;"You have trouble reaching clear and logical consequences and to approach life's topics with reservation. Your power of concentration is strongly dependent on your momentary mood and the distraction of your every day worries that, at times, overwhelm you. People cannot help but get the impression that you know your rights but do not take your responsibilities seriously enough, an accusation you emphatically deny. This aspect makes it difficult for you to see yourself objectively. Take the advice of people you trust before others start avoiding you.



It is possible that you will develop an interest in esoteric fields. It would be wonderful if you would finally take on some responsibility and learn to estimate the situation you are in. Although you have a talent for sensing the emotional state of others intuitively, you seldom put them to use because you are so busy fighting your own battles. You should really try to use your positive qualities constructively instead of succumbing to the temptation to escape from reality."
186;RADIX_0000000002375810;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Pluto;An extraordinary power of reason lets you quickly get down to the essence of a situation. You speak your mind without worrying about what people will think. To avoid unnecessary conflicts, it would be good to keep quiet and develop abilities that will enable you to compromise. Learn to accept limits and be considerate of the feelings of others, especially in arguments. Verbal wounds are often more difficult to heal than physical wounds. Try to overcome your distrust and open yourself up. This will make your life more enjoyable. There is no reason not to try being honest for a change. Possibly you are actually trying to control other people's lives, making up rules that you expect to be followed. Try to be a little more tolerant and consider the opinions of others more seriously.
187;RADIX_0000000008405122;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;"If you do not draw the necessary consequences from your experiences, and take the time to work them through, you will only make things hard on yourself. Resistance to accepting the signs of the times and to giving up outdated ways of thinking comes from stubbornness. Instead of approaching solutions to your problems open and optimistically, your thoughts run in circles. Probably you have not realized that there are many opportunities and that it is up to you to make use of them.



In making decisions, you may be torn between the pros and cons of the issues and not be able to follow one direction consequently. Make an effort to take part in the events so that you are informed and can discuss them. That could change your mind, revealing a better way. Try to get in on discussions and devote yourself to good literature that will make you more critical of your ideas."
188;RADIX_0000000009191554;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"Possibly you have difficulty making yourself understood and expressing yourself understandably. For this reason you should be careful not to let yourself become isolated or to withdraw into a fantasy world because you tend to over-intellectualize your dealings with others. A dose of empathy for others never hurts anyone.



Even if you usually make a regal and independent impression, deep inside you feel a need to bond with people. For this reason, it would do you good to allow yourself to get deeply involved with another person. Otherwise, you may remain lonely. Although before making this type of statement, it is necessary to consult your entire horoscope."
189;RADIX_0000000009453698;Your Mercury in Opposition with Your MC;"In coordinating family life with a career you have encountered a number of problems. Communication with others suffers from misunderstandings, making it difficult for you to express the creative potential you have been blessed with. If you were more willing to compromise, your relations with others would become more relaxed.



These difficulties with communication can be rooted in your childhood and youth, especially if your relationship to your parents was stressed by intense conflicts. Maybe you were closer to one parent than to the other and tried to play your parents out against each other. In the end, you will be challenged to rethink the way you talk to people and find new ways to get a grip on your life."
190;RADIX_0000000001081474;Your Mercury in Square with Your Mars;"Even with your ability to think rationally, you sometimes present your convictions passionately. Actually, your considerable intellectual capacity should enable you to solve the most complex problems, although even arguments of little significance can enrage you when you are contradicted. You love discussions and debates, but you should know that a certain amount of tact would be useful. Because diplomacy is not exactly your strong point, you should make an effort to cultivate a feeling for tact, at least minimally. Also, do not take yourself too seriously. There are people living on this planet who have other opinions and have the same right to live as you have. Before you make a decision you should review all the facts, listen to various opinions on the subject and consider all this carefully.



Make an effort to be more patient and to listen better to what others have to say. Your views may not always be free of inconsistencies and even if you are thoroughly convinced it may still be that others have different opinions."
191;RADIX_0000000001343618;Your Mercury in Square with Your Jupiter;It would be an improvement for you to put more effort into putting your ideas into practice. It does not accomplish anything to start the day enthusiastically and then resign the minute complications start to hamper your progress.

Basically, your thinking is not always realistic and your self-image could be more objective. Frequently you exaggerate your abilities and end up feeling overburdened, which can be critical when others find out that your enthusiasm was not sincere. Try to keep reason and imagination in balance and know when it is time to pull the emergency brake.
192;RADIX_0000000001605762;Your Mercury in Square with Your Saturn;"Probably you panic easily. This could be due to your traditional way of thinking, which cannot keep pace with today's rapid development. Possibly your childhood contributed to your tendency to place limits on your imagination and lose yourself in details. When you do have good ideas, somebody will usually claim them as their own and rob you of the credit.



In your sexual relationships jealously does not play a large role. Your fear of change gives you an inclination to cling to tradition. It is difficult for you to be content with your accomplishments, which is why you always expect criticism. If you should ever attain an influential position, you could make a habit out of criticizing other people's ideas and denying them the recognition they deserve.



Be fair with yourself. Exaggerated self-criticism can become so extreme that the sight of your reflection in the mirror can cause you to burst into tears. A more optimistic outlook on life could help you to get a better grip on your daily work."
193;RADIX_0000000001867906;Your Mercury in Square with Your Uranus;"With your mind constantly running at full speed, it will not be easy for you to turn off your thoughts. You should learn to relax and loosen up, tomorrow will always be there. That will prevent your impatience from developing into a condition of nervous exhaustion. Although you are mentally active and have original ideas, your tangled thoughts may lead you to put your focus on unrealistic projects. Sometimes you seem to be absentminded and occasionally jump to absurd conclusions that have not been thoroughly considered. The spontaneous character of Uranus causes the hectic pace that your life sometimes takes on.



There is a stubborn and rebellious side to your intellect that can cause you to be rejected by people who find your attitude overbearing. The matter gets complicated when you start rapidly changing your opinions on everything and are unwilling to listen to any kind of advice. An overnight transformation could throw your life into turmoil because you are constantly on the lookout for exciting and unusual experiences. The ethical values of your behavior are only of secondary importance because you consider yourself to be above societal norms. Finally, do not make yourself out to be so important that you suppress your responsibility to keep your obstinacy under control."
194;RADIX_0000000002130050;Your Mercury in Square with Your Neptune;"Probably you give the impression of lacking concentration and dreaming the day away. For this reason, you have not developed organizational talents for taking care of your every day obligations and others cannot help but get the impression that you know what you need to do but do not take your responsibilities seriously enough, an accusation you emphatically deny. This aspect makes it difficult for you to see yourself in an objective light. Listen to the advice of people you trust before others start avoiding you.

195;RADIX_0000000002392194;Your Mercury in Square with Your Pluto;Extraordinary power of reason lets you quickly get down to the essence of a situation. You speak your mind without worrying about what people will think. To avoid unnecessary conflicts, it would be good to keep quiet sometimes and think about becoming more disciplined, this will calm down your critics. You live secluded and are distrustful, although there is no reason not to try being open and honest for a change. Possibly you actually are trying to control other people's lives. Take care, because the history books are full of people who gave their best to take control over others, only to be forced to their knees in the end. Confront other people's convictions and accept their right to have a different opinion, because everybody has their own truth.
196;RADIX_0000000008421506;Your Mercury in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;"You could have a hard time openly confronting people and conducting an honest conversation. It is not easy for you to pull your head together and judge the situation objectively. Possibly you resist logic and get yourself into unpleasant situations. Business sense is not exactly your strong point, which is why you should consider every large transaction carefully. You may think that your education is insufficient; why have you been putting off compensating for your deficiency?



Mental clarity comes from the exchange with others. Use communication to tackle any problems that may arise or you will be handicapped in your life's journey. Be more diplomatic even if it sometimes feels awkward. Take the challenge and look for contact to others."
197;RADIX_0000000009207938;Your Mercury in Square with Your Ascendant;"Possibly you have difficulty making yourself understood and expressing yourself understandably.

199;RADIX_0000000001097858;Your Mercury in Trine with Your Mars;"By working constructively and using your intellectual power, you could succeed intellectually. Others notice and appreciate your imaginative enrichment of several aspects of daily life. If you ever suffer from nervousness you should be able to keep it under control well enough to secure the success of whatever it is that you are doing. Even if you are not the greatest scientific authority, you could go into a technical profession.



As a brilliant writer and debater, you have excellent qualifications for journalism and politics. Your great interest in taking part in political debates is supportive. Recognizing larger connections is easy for you and your ability impresses people who are willing to help you spread your ideas. Although you have good concentration you should make sure that you stay with your activities long enough to finish them."
200;RADIX_0000000001360002;Your Mercury in Trine with Your Jupiter;"In addition to learning fast and being good at presenting ideas and concepts, you generally take care of your day to day work quite well. If you have a position at a university or another educational institution, this aspect will be advantageous because Mercury deals with practical and logical thought processes and Jupiter with the area of higher education. A good general education is especially important to you, so much so that you will not let any opportunity go by. If you have literary ambitions, then go for it because no other aspect can provide as much support as this one. Use the power of positive thinking because enthusiasm and optimism are sure to bring success.



As an honest and upright person, you are in a position to keep track of the consequences of your actions. Practicing tolerance and benevolence toward all people enables you to reach out to people and explain the importance of a particular goal. With this you are often convincing.



An exploratory expedition out into the great wide world has long been an ambition of yours, which you should definitely realize. With some appropriate professional training, you could go into the field of tourism. Your hospitality is widely appreciated and probably comes from your experiences with hosts in other countries."
201;RADIX_0000000001622146;Your Mercury in Trine with Your Saturn;"Intellectually, you are disciplined and intelligent and clearly represent the positions that you have worked out during your lifetime. Look for a profession requiring intellectual work. Certainly, you are in a position to organize larger projects well enough to satisfy everyone. Sensitivity and common sense characterize your decisions. Everything you take on is well structured and carried out systematically.



Your childhood was characterized by your achievements in school. Even then you did not want to leave anything to chance, but planned every step with determination, whereby you devote yourself to studies that are comprehensive and well structured. The older kids at school and your parents encouraged you to achieve the dedication and endurance that you have today."
202;RADIX_0000000001884290;Your Mercury in Trine with Your Uranus;"You have well-developed intellectual and rhetorical abilities and come up with original thoughts. Intuitively, you can differentiate right from wrong and often happen to be at the right place at the right time to make connections that later turn out to be useful. Today's hectic pace of developments cannot intimidate you because you are flexible enough to deal with it.



A deep interest in esoteric fields awakens your longing for a better understanding of the fundamental structures of life. You could probably achieve this if you devote yourself to the study of Astrology.



Mercury represents all the areas of communication, while Uranus is concerned with developments in electronics. This aspect could make you inclined to choose a profession dealing with electronic communications, especially in light of the rapid expansion of this field in conjunction with the increasing role of computers. It would be a shame if you did not put your unconventional way of thinking to work to bring about improvements for everyone."
203;RADIX_0000000002146434;Your Mercury in Trine with Your Neptune;"You have the ability to intuitively sense the emotional state of people around you. Although your active imagination may cause your judgments to overshoot the boundaries, you will acquire a diplomatic way of presenting the truth in some phase of your life. Your interests, focused on mystic and esoteric fields, find their expression in written form.



Constant daydreaming should have an effect on your poetic, literary or other creative talents as well as further your qualifications for all professions involving imaginative thinking, such as photography and design. People often find you unreliable. Instead of debating issues you simply do what feels right. In financial matters, your success is due to your ability to sense future developments of various world markets. Using deception, you manage to arrange things before others have a chance to notice."
204;RADIX_0000000002408578;Your Mercury in Trine with Your Pluto;"It would be good for you to learn to think of reality as an exchange of energies and to recognize the basis of the physical world. Although you will not be dealing exclusively with such questions, as they involve other factors as well, this aspect will give you the ability to see behind the scenes.



Basically, you are an objective person and keep an open mind, whereby the truth is more important to you than just getting involved in something. Use your imaginative capacity together with your willpower to reach for higher goals and secure the support of others.



Your sensitivity in solving the most complex problems makes you well suited for research especially in ecology. This field leads the life of Cinderella at her stepmother's house, in spite of the urgent need for both the developments of alternative energy sources and research into renewable sources of energy.



Maybe you want to acquire the wisdom of esoteric fields, whereby you should not put yourself under pressure and should try your hand at Astrology."

Interesting conversations are always a pleasure, whereby you keep yourself open to new ideas. The intellectual exchange with others and especially with your brothers and sisters helps you to keep a realistic image of yourself. False modesty is a foreign concept to you because you are very well aware of the value of your work and are not ashamed to accept compensation. Success in business should not be out of your reach because you keep yourself informed and can use the information profitably.



If you do not reject it every time reason whispers in your ear, this aspect could prove to be helpful in reaching your life's aspiration."
206;RADIX_0000000009224322;Your Mercury in Trine with Your Ascendant;"Basically, you should know what you are after and also be in a position to make the people around you understand. When you are in a group, you always try to keep the atmosphere relaxed. A thirst for knowledge motivates you to keep up with the latest developments; your professional life may also deal with publicizing knowledge and new developments. To remain intellectually fit, you enjoy debates but avoid conflicts. Intuitively you know exactly what is expected of you and you are always able to impress your colleagues. Maybe you have a tendency to be intellectually arrogant, although an astrological interpretation should never be reduced to a single aspect."
207;RADIX_0000000009486466;Your Mercury in Trine with Your MC;"Coordinating family and professional affairs is a trick that you have mastered. Also getting to know people is easy for you due to your communication skills, which also allow you to express your creative potential.

208;RADIX_0000000000852098;Your Mercury in Sextile with Your Venus;With this aspect you should have a talent for expressing yourself both orally and in writing. Maybe you are a writer or work in some other area of communication, whereby a life as an artist is not beyond your reach. You have no idea of what you could do to improve your financial situation, but that should be alrightfor you because you do not really want to force a specific outcome. People usually get along with you because you try to live in harmony with everyone and are good at making compromises. Work in the background is easier for you than standing in the limelight. People appreciate you for your ability to judge events objectively. However, when it comes to your justified interests you will never give in, but will make your standpoint clear with charm and diplomacy. You like to spend time with others and your optimism makes everyone feel good This carefree and easy life will be reflected at work, even during those phases in which you cannot make yourself comply with regular procedures.
209;RADIX_0000000001114242;Your Mercury in Sextile with Your Mars;"Even with your sharp intellect and mental capacity, there are some questions you cannot answer. In your volunteer work you can count on the support of others because you defend your positions clearly. This aspect is especially advantageous for work in the area of journalism and in research, because you love to stick your nose into others people's business. You say whatever you feel like saying, making it possible for you to make a clear decision and act accordingly.



Out of interest for politics and social affairs you are frequently found among people who love discussions and are prone to giving speeches. When it comes to arousing support for your positions, you are no novice. However, you should be more considerate of the feelings of others. With this winning combination you have good chances of achieving whatever you set out to do."
210;RADIX_0000000001376386;Your Mercury in Sextile with Your Jupiter;"This aspect should expand your consciousness and arouse your interest in studies of philosophical and moral questions that will open doors to your social and professional success.

The intellectual exchange with others and especially with your brothers and sisters helps you to keep a realistic image of yourself. False modesty is a foreign concept to you because you are very well aware of the value of your work and are not ashamed to accept compensation.

You should take a look at its aspects to the other planets to find out more about your intellectual habits and your ability to learn. In addition, you could tell how you cope with experiences.



If Mercury receives challenging aspects, you will probably reject the ruling definition of intelligence, because you believe that there are forms of thought other then logic.

Your mother may have encouraged this and seemed to be eloquent and sure of herself or outwitted and irresponsible. Therefore your mother may have strongly influenced your convictions.

We can learn a lot from each other. You sense a need to get to know a lot of people and talk to them. You invest a lot of time finding out about other opinions and also what others think about you. 



You are looking for a partner for intense discussions. Usually you are interested in a lot of different people and have trouble deciding on one; you never know who else might show up.

Your observational powers and remarkable vision, which also allow you to see in the dark, are especially remarkable. You have the ability to see through all kinds of human relationships, regardless of where you run into them. You may be in the finance or business world or in the field of psychology. In that case, you will be most interested in working on topics like sex and death.



You approach people open and easily. It never takes long for you to trust someone and then share your thoughts with them. You live in your own world which others find very strange. In spite of this you are capable of deep insights. You can remove yourself and analyze problems objectively, especially those which usually arouse fear or emotional outbreaks. You should reexamine the details of every contract you sign as well as every verbal agreement to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings.



People who have Mercury in the sign Gemini or Virgo and in the eighth house are adept at the sciences."
226;RADIX_0000000000131206;Your Mercury in the Ninth House;"With the planet Mercury in the ninth house you see things from a distant and sober perspective. Your conviction that everything on Earth and in the universe can be rationally understood and explained brings you to a deeper comprehension of the fundamental regularities. You should give in to your need to travel and study, but pay special attention to alternatives to the dogmatic, traditional forms and institutions. You may be inclined to take in everything that fits in with your way of thinking and to ignore everything else.



You want to tell others about your experiences and arouse interest in the things that impressed you the most. Your profession is probably publishing, advertising or in the travel industry. You may have friends who live in other countries. A trip to farthest reaches of the Earth will fundamentally influence your concept of the world."
227;RADIX_0000000000147590;Your Mercury in the Tenth House;"Mercury's qualities of communication and intellectual consideration will not do you any good alone in your room. They should be put to use among people. You may be able to incorporate your capabilities in this area into your profession. You could work in publishing or in retail for media and telecommunications products. You could also distinguish yourself by solving logistical problems. Your profession is very important because you sharpen your intellect and judgment. You want to be recognized for your rational faculties. You feel flattered when your intellectual capacity is praised.



The tenth house is associated with the father and will influence your image of him. If he made an intelligent and cosmopolitan impression, you may have tried to imitate him as a child. He pointed out the advantages of a good education and made sure that you had good teachers and were taught to articulate well.



If Mercury would receive challenging aspects in the tenth house, it could lead to conflicts with your parents, especially with your father, which you should clear up in the coming years."
228;RADIX_0000000000163974;Your Mercury in the Eleventh House;"Friends and activities within organizations have helped you to see yourself and the world in its larger context. You do not like to work on problems in solitude, but prefer to join people with similar convictions who can expand your horizons. You appreciate other people's suggestions and work on finding ways to improve social conditions.



Possibly you will join a group based on a common belief or a similar view of the world because you are convinced that people actively committed to change can achieve more when they band together. Your commitment to the members of your group has created an intimacy that makes you want to represent the group's interests in public. Just watch out that you do not ignore the interests of individual group members, this could provoke conflicts.



If the planet Mercury receives challenging aspects in the eleventh house, you may be inclined to burden your friends with the responsibility you should carry yourself; either that or you continually give your right arm for your friends and wind up feeling used. Stay in touch with your siblings, they could become your best friends."
229;RADIX_0000000000180358;Your Mercury in the Twelfth House;"Mercury in the twelfth house of your birth chart evokes unusual thoughts. The sooner you confront everything you run into the sooner you will understand. In the twelfth house, Mercury is trying to establish a connection between the subconscious and the conscious. You should start to explore the depths of your soul. But do not lose yourself in it to the point of neglecting your daily responsibilities. You could try to get through to your subconscious using meditation techniques and find out what kind of powers can be drawn from it. It may be worthwhile to dig up what is hidden there and put it to use. There may be other things that are best removed from your life.



Your mind will run into difficulties recognizing its limits. The twelfth house is the house where the ego melts. Your thoughts could get mixed up with your surroundings, which will probably be confusing.



You could make positive use of the energies of the twelfth house. If you have the possibility to support others, then you should not hesitate to do that; you may find that you are more relaxed and may be able to earn a living at it.



Protect yourself from negative thoughts, for they are the root of many problems. If you succeed in organizing your thoughts and imagination without losing contact to your friends, you may find that what you thought was a barrier is a blessing."
230;RADIX_0000000000000196;Venus - The Way of Loving;"The planet Venus requires about 224 days to orbit the Sun. It is about the size of the Earth. We can often observe Venus with the naked eye because it shines like no other planet. Like Mercury, it can be either a morning or an evening star and can be maximally 48 degrees away from the Sun, producing the only possible aspect to the Sun, a conjunction.



The radiant beauty of this celestial body caused Venus or Aphrodite to be honored as goddess of beauty and love. After Zeus threw his sperm into the sea, she arose having been born of foam. Her beauty did not only bring harmony, but provoked the Trojan war. In Astrology, Venus stands for everything that we find beautiful and desirable. Its place in the horoscope tells us about our requirements for peaceful, harmonious surroundings, our love life and our ability to sacrifice. The arts, especially music, are associated with Venus, as is our sense of aesthetics and our preferences in the art of seduction or being seduced. As evening star Venus is associated with the sign Libra, as morning star with Taurus."
231;RADIX_0000000000000193;Your Venus in Aries;"In romantic affairs you are spirited and do not have any false inhibitions. Regardless of your gender, you do not hesitate to make the first move and are usually quite successful. You can deal with stormy emotions and play out your passions. You are willing to accept rejection and never give up. Sexuality is very important to you, and you are open for anything and everything. There is action wherever you go. You are always a welcome guest, provided you have managed to learn a little diplomacy. You do not play games, but let others know if you are happy or not.



You try to avoid becoming dependent in relationships and never lose sight of your freedom. This can make it difficult to have longterm relationships. You are impulsive and can fall in love again the next day. Be considerate of the feelings of others."
232;RADIX_0000000000016577;Your Venus in Taurus;"Venus in the sign Taurus makes you capable of stable, long-lasting relationships. You look for security and fidelity in a partner. When you find someone appropriate for you, you do not let go easily. You may have problems with your jealousy. You tend to want to own your lover and suffer from separation anxiety. If this is not the case, your partner can depend on you. You are not the type to play around; you take relationships seriously and are too complacent to want to instigate a strenuous adventure.



You are a sensuous person and take to pleasures. You may be knowledgeable of the arts or be an exquisite cook. You probably decorate your home tastefully and have made it comfortable. You pay close attention to your appearance, enjoy grooming and dressing up. If you are out to catch someone, you are unusually patient and offer a variety of enticements. You like to give flowers because they make you so happy. Taurus's connection to the throat often means a full, melodious voice; you should try singing sometime."
233;RADIX_0000000000032961;Your Venus in Gemini;You can be extremely charming and usually find the right words to make a compliment or to make an impression in good society. If you want to convince someone that you are in love, your coddling will get them. You are extremely curious and always want to know what people are wearing and who is sleeping with whom. You should take care not to get lost in superficialities. Your insatiable curiosity, in spite of its sparkle, has the negative quality of causing you to become bored quickly. An occasional change of pace is very important to you. You approach strangers with ease. You are not the type for intense, serious relationships, but when you have gotten caught up in one, you can be faithful. It is easy for you to express your true feelings. This is why you demand honesty in a relationship. You have a weakness for the aesthetics of language and may enjoy writing poetry. You may also like to dance.
234;RADIX_0000000000049345;Your Venus in Cancer;"You have no problems opening yourself up and giving yourself to your partner without holding back. You need to feel close to others and like the feeling you get when you are protecting someone. You take loving care of your children. But you will have to learn to let go when the time comes. You enjoy decorating your home to make it your castle. You are very sensitive and are often hurt, even if no offense was intended.



Sometimes you feel off balance, this may be dependent on the phases of the moon. You should first strive for your own independence before entering an adventure like a relationship. You develop a dependency quickly and may even let yourself be oppressed in a relationship. You do your best to avoid fighting with you family, although it is not always constructive. Do not let yourself appear weaker than you are, but discover your limitless capacity for love and make it a gift to someone close to you."
235;RADIX_0000000000065729;Your Venus in Leo;"You love life and have a large heart, but your pride and vanity tend to make your romantic relationships complicated. You seek approval in relationships. The most exciting time for you is in a new relationship with someone who worships you.



The opposite sex is attracted by your charm and your pronounced femininity or masculinity. Once you have found a partner you can remain faithful and be very tender. You are good with children, so a happy family life is definitely not beyond your reach. The people you love get to know your generosity; you try to read their wishes in their eyes.



You love to be the center of attention and are insulted when you are overlooked. Instead of wasting your energy preparing grandiose appearances, initiate creative projects."
236;RADIX_0000000000082113;Your Venus in Virgo;"It takes you a while before you get to the point where you can concentrate on your partner. Your approach to relationships is rather sober. It is not likely that you will be swept away with passion. Your rationality is your trusted companion in every endeavor. You may be motivated to enter a relationship only when it promises to be useful to you or seems to be a rational solution. You do not see your partner through rose-colored glasses and do not let yourself be deceived. You are capable of analyzing your feelings and keep a realistic perspective.



At work you command great respect. You are known for your fairness and kindness. People appreciate the sensitivity with which you solve any problems that may arise. The troubles of your colleagues do not leave you untouched. You may follow your career together with your partner.



You never neglect your responsibility to your family. The way you care for those around you serves as an example for others. People know they can rely on you. It should be possible for you to be a little warmer in expressing your feelings. Be aware that your children need more than a perfectly organized daily routine. They need warmth and to feel close to you. Do not be too strict if your high expectations are not always met. Some things are better overlooked."
237;RADIX_0000000000098497;Your Venus in Libra;"You need more love and attention than most people do. You want to be accepted and have harmonious relationships. It could go so far that you lose your identity and define yourself only in terms of your relationship. It is especially important for you to be aware of your inner values and to seem confident.



You love parties and all other kinds of social occasions, because these give you the opportunity to meet people. Your appearance and charm makes it easy for you to approach strangers. You take great care in selecting your personal style, clothing and furniture and find that your efforts beautify your surroundings. You are knowledgeable about the arts and may find career perspectives in this area.



Harmony is very important to you. You cannot stand it when people around you fight or use rough words. You will not be able to get around developing your determination and protecting your interests in the face of resistance. You can give others a lot, but only if you are good to yourself. You do not have financial problems to speak of, because you attract money and have a good eye for finances."
238;RADIX_0000000000114881;Your Venus in Scorpio;"Venus in Scorpio presents the challenge to keep your passions under control, to keep yourself from being eaten alive by them. You love under the principle ""everything or nothing"" and also expect your partner to give his or her all. Traditional astrology tells that you have a tendency for secret affairs, sexual excesses, jealousy and revenge. You have to decide for yourself if this sounds like you.



You have high expectations of a relationship and look for perfect fulfillment. You can easily give yourself to your lover and expect the same in return. Sexuality is very important for you because it helps you to overcome inner limitations and tap new energy sources. If your lover is unfaithful you are so devastated that you end the relationship. You usually are not in good standing with previous partners; once you have separated from someone, you do not grieve long over the lost relationship. That is the contradiction in your character: your relationships are very intense, but you quickly come to a point where you can put a definitive end to it. Just as quickly you find someone new. The erotic appeal heightened in flirtations that are more important to you does not go unnoticed. Extraordinary people interest you more, even if the contexts in which they draw attention to themselves are not always positive."
239;RADIX_0000000000131265;Your Venus in Sagittarius;"Mutual respect is what you value in relationships over everything else. When you love, you can rise to such spiritual heights that you sometimes have trouble coming down to Earth. You endeavor to realize all of your ideals in the partnership. Hopefully you are aware that this is no easy task. Your cheery disposition and positive outlook will open a lot of doors for you, but not enough to satisfy you. Your search for spiritual truths leads you to sisterly love and social development.



You demand absolute honesty in a relationship. You can lavish affection on your lover, but once in a while you see around your rose-colored glasses and devote your attention to everyday responsibilities, otherwise you could wake up to a nightmare.



You usually abide by the traditional morality, unless Venus has an unpleasant aspect, you are able to tolerate all forms of peaceful coexistence. You tend to excesses in your aesthetic taste, like dreaming about installing a chandelier on your living room ceiling, but somehow you manage to get away with it."
240;RADIX_0000000000147649;Your Venus in Capricorn;"You may be the most faithful spouse imaginable. It takes a long time before you work up the courage to approach someone on an erotic level, but you have a steady emotional disposition. If you do lose control and give in to passion, it is an exception. For you a relationship means security and stability. You can also communicate this to your partner.



You are certainly not trendy; you much prefer classical art forms to modern forms of expression. Your outward appearance is probably oriented to conservative taste. A splash of color or a different pattern could provide more life to your outfit. You prefer the company of educated people who have status. Hopefully you do not go too far and become a snob. It would do you good to let yourself be a little more open and casual. On the other hand, people know they can rely on you when they need your help.



You may tend toward older partners, who make you feel more secure or are drawn to offer security to younger people. In either case, you can bond intimately and become a rock of stability for your partner."
241;RADIX_0000000000164033;Your Venus in Aquarius;"You need plenty of freedom in a relationship and fight tooth and nail against being chained to a specific person. Anyone seeking a long-term relationship with you will have to accept that and be prepared to live their own life. You despise dependency and jealousy and find your own form of harmonious coexistence. Your views on love, sex and marriage probably are not accepted by the majority. A good friendship is more important to you than eternal love. Your relationships can end just as suddenly as they began.



You probably have had a lot of affairs and fall in love often. Your unconventional attitude can easily confuse your partners. Your own instability does not make things any easier. You can only work for a cause if your whole heart is in it. Your associates notice it too, and let themselves get caught up in your enthusiasm. You would much rather be part of a large group than spend your lifetime in dedication to one person. This may come out of fear of letting anyone get too close.



You prefer modern art forms, because Uranus has a connection to technology and electronics. You like to listen to techno music."
242;RADIX_0000000000180417;Your Venus in Pisces;"In Pisces, Venus can unfold a love which can hardly be equaled. When you look at your love life you may be reminded of old Hollywood films where good taste gives way to ""kitsch"". You are also capable of a pure, selfless love, never expecting recompense for your efforts.



What you would like the most is to melt together with your beloved or to dissolve in your emotions. You are prepared to give yourself completely and expect the same of your partner. Romance plays an important role in your relationships, you want to chase and be chased. If you have not yet found your center you will want constant confirmations of acceptance making yourself more vulnerable than you are.



You are very sensitive and have great understanding for other peoples' burdens. If you are able to help someone out, it makes you feel good. You can let yourself be used, because you do not always see the interrelations realistically. You can get involved on all social levels, running the risk of overloading yourself. Take care that the strain does not affect your health.



You are probably a creative person with an active imagination, inspired to actively create. If you have not done anything in this area, it is high time to let your hidden talents come to the light. Do not forget to take care of yourself, too, and do not give up your dreams. You could lead an emotionally satisfying life."
243;RADIX_0000000001048770;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Mars;"You are full of passion that needs to be vented so that you do not end up turning it against yourself. This aspect may primarily have a sexual significance, but it does not mean that its energy cannot be used for other purposes, especially in the areas of art and music. Social welfare is also an area of special interest to you. In light of the deplorable state of affairs, you could be torn between deep sympathy and an attitude which allows you to ask yourself ""is this my business?""



Because you love life, you should try to keep a lid on the aggressive and stormy potential of Mars, which is easy to hold off by its connection to Venus. The principle of love, symbolized by Venus, has a physical emphasis due to its connection with Mars, which actually should not be dominant. It would be nice if you could keep these two powers in balance.



Maybe your financial resources are in a bitter state. It may be necessary to keep careful track of your credit cards because you tend be too generous. It would be advantageous for you to learn to be a little more careful with money. This will save you aggravation."
244;RADIX_0000000001310914;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Jupiter;"As an extremely generous person, you bring an incredible amount of enthusiasm and joy in your every day life. This can sweep people away and give you hope and comfort in times of need. You love a good party, any kind of party, and you are able to organize a festivity to everyone's satisfaction. As a token of support for people who are not as well off as you are, it is important to you to donate money to worthy causes.



The principle of harmonious love can combine with Jupiter's expanding tendencies to develop diplomatic abilities that enable you to mediate between people on several social levels.



Comfort and luxury are important to you, but that does not mean you have to throw your money out the window. If you want to bring out the positive qualities of this aspect and be able to greet others with kindness, you will receive the acknowledgment and respect you need."
245;RADIX_0000000001573058;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Saturn;"In judging situations as well as people, you tend to be realistic. This ensures you a materially satisfying foundation for life and causes people to ask you for advice. Having a frugal nature will help to secure a suitable environment for your old age. If Venus is able to assert itself in spite of Saturn's sobriety, your creative aptitude will manifest itself in an adequate expression and you will be able to develop a tranquil nature that will be widely appreciated.



If you should discover a scientific field that arouses your interest, it could very well lead to successful employment. You probably place a lot of value on working independently, because you can concentrate better.



A pronounced sense of fairness and solidarity has helped you to remain largely free of prejudices. Occasional shyness does not prevent you from making long-lasting friendships. The ability to recognize problems as they are developing supports your day to day struggles."
246;RADIX_0000000001835202;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Uranus;"A joyous character is responsible for your popularity, even if you are not always able to resist life's temptations and readily take part in every amusement. Although this quality may be what others appreciate most in you. You know how to enjoy yourself and are a welcome guest at parties and other events, because you usually think of some way to pleasantly surprise others. Spontaneous creative urges find expression in the arts whereby you emphasize your originality and cannot call enough attention to it.



Your charitable attitude has become such a part of you that you are no longer able to free yourself from a feeling of responsibility for the entire human race. This is certainly praiseworthy, but may overwhelm you. In erotic relationships, you sometimes give your partner the impression that you do not know what you want. Today, you are head-over-heals in love and tomorrow already searching for a new erotic adventure. This may sound extreme, but may not actually be so obscure. Sometime during the course of your life you should develop an appreciation for long-term relationships."
247;RADIX_0000000002097346;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Neptune;"In your erotic relationships you pay careful attention to romance. Everywhere where Neptune plays a role, creativity, vision and illusion are involved. Your level of maturity is the most important factor in determining whether you will be able to develop realistic ideas or if you let yourself slip off into a dream world. If you ever find yourself in a position to use this aspect positively, it will help you to find true love. Because you are imaginative and receptive to all forms of beauty, your presence is enough to make others happy, feel tranquil and at ease.



Being attractive can have positive or negative effects; these will largely be determined by your motivation. The problem in it is that you may be quite gullible. Someone promising to bring you the stars down from heaven can take you in. Watch out that you do not get cheated. Basically, you are a good person, but you should not assume that everyone else is.



Maybe mystical sounds have an influence on you or you are artistically active in some form or other. Because all activity relevant to capturing pictures on celluloid is under Neptune's influence, you could feel drawn to photography or the film industry."
248;RADIX_0000000002359490;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Pluto;"Passion is such a necessary part of life for you that you may often cause a crisis that then has to be dealt with. If you are one of those people who have successfully overcome their ego, you can rely on a higher love in your day-to-day dealings with the people around you. This will draw people to you.



Whenever the planet Venus plays a role, creative artwork is the result; in your case it will probably take the form of acting. As mentioned previously, you should not let your sexual passions go completely unrestrained. The tremendous creative energies you have been given will provide you with a path that will lead you away from an abyss of love and passion. All you have to do is find it."
249;RADIX_0000000008388802;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;"This is a great aspect that should provide ample opportunity to improve your quality of life using the charm and effortless success that has characterized your life. People tend to treat you well because you approach people wholeheartedly and let them know that you like them. Love plays an important role in your life. It is what may bring you great joy and fulfillment.



Support the development of your creativity by devoting yourself more to art. In this area you are capable of substantial achievements because you know how to express hopes and wishes. Any conflict in your proximity inspires you to try to reestablish harmony. This is possible only through your own inner tranquillity. Continuing to work toward this goal is the right way for you to attain your ambitions and leave the past behind you."
250;RADIX_0000000009175234;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"As charming as you are, you will be popular no matter where you go; it may become so extreme that it makes you feel uneasy. All you really want is to be accepted. Out of love for the pleasant side of life, you will do everything you can to make yourself comfortable and enjoy yourself as much as possible. As attractive as you are, this should be no problem. There is a danger that you will become overconfident after an initial success. If at some point one of your wishes is denied, try to control yourself and do not be insulted. Realize that although you are important, there are other people in the world whose rights should be respected."
251;RADIX_0000000009437378;Your Venus in Conjunction with Your MC;"The way you deal with people can best be described as charming. This is especially helpful professionally, because diplomacy is your strong point. Venus is responsible for all the nice things in life, which may make it possible for you to go into an artistic profession. Maybe you work in an art gallery or are involved with publishing art of some kind. If you are female, you are assured of your boss' approval.



Probably, you were the apple of your father's eye, although both of your parents were proud of you which means you should guard against becoming your parent's prestige object. Romantic relationships are important to you and will help you to acquire a high standing in the course of your life; later you may be a magnet for wealth."
252;RADIX_0000000001065154;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Mars;"This aspect may cause emotional problems especially in your partnership because your potential for love and aggression do not harmonize with each other. Sometimes you behave as if the only purpose for a partnership were to satisfy your sexual desires, an attitude that upsets your partner. Maybe you should work on developing tact and get a grip on your instincts in order to take better care of yourself. Although you are emotionally very sensitive, this does not necessarily make you aware of the vulnerability of the people around you. This can cause conflicts and other difficulties.



Possibly, Venus' ever-present desire to preserve harmony has prevented you from developing assertiveness and from setting clear limits. In this case, you should try to direct your vision on your goals and do not make detours to avoid conflicts."
253;RADIX_0000000001327298;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Jupiter;"Possibly, your sweetness is enough to get on everybody's nerves. If you are rich, you could make a spoiled and gluttonous impression on people. Rushing from one party to the next so as not to miss anything, you seem to forget that life is not only about rights, but also includes obligations. Especially if you were fortunate enough to have a sheltered childhood, you always expect to be the center of attention and take a lot of things for granted; an attitude that will get you nowhere.



At times you seem to be very sentimental, that is until someone actually expects help from you. Do not give in to the temptation to consume sweets excessively or collect status symbols. If you can manage to take on more responsibility in your everyday life, others will see you in a more positive light."
254;RADIX_0000000001589442;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Saturn;Frustration and financial difficulties may be an unavoidable part of your life. Possibly you have experienced disappointment and defeat since your early childhood, and your desire to be loved and respected are not necessarily fulfilled to your satisfaction. Even if Saturn is able to restrict the harmonious qualities of Venus a little, do not let it get you down. Make sure that that you do not turn into a cynic who holds everybody but himself responsible for his fate. Develop your ability to judge objectively, then you will be better able to get a grip on your own personal situation. Look towards the positive side of life, get out and meet people, then you will be better able to expect something for yourself.
255;RADIX_0000000001851586;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Uranus;"This opposition indicates liability. On your search for pleasure, you forget to consider the consequences. Because you are constantly getting involved in new erotic adventures which mean everything to you while they last, you will have difficulties getting involved in a longterm relationship. Try to be more frugal.



Emotional abstinence can become so extreme that you do not even listen to your own inner voice. It is against your principles to listen to advice of others. A strong need for autonomy at any price will make it difficult for you to take on the responsibility of a partnership. Do not be amazed if you feel lonely later in life."
256;RADIX_0000000002113730;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Neptune;"Emotionally you are guided by internal energies. Sometimes you hinder yourself in financial affairs, in your partnership and in creative matters. Subconscious wishes can sometimes distort your perception of reality.



Guard yourself against letting your basic dissatisfaction with life and your intense love of pleasurable experiences develop into a drug addiction. This will have financial and professional consequences. Also, the planet Neptune can lead to a tendency to hide private difficulties until things are forced out into the open, whereby your partnership will not suddenly break up, but will dissolve slowly."
257;RADIX_0000000002375874;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Pluto;"This opposition brings with it the danger that you will become entangled in intensive emotional and sexual relations, which are not exactly characterized by harmony. Your temperament that you sometimes are not able to keep under control could take a lot out of you. In your partnerships, you insist on taking on the dominant role or encounter difficulties in mutual financial dealings.



Do not let your passions become destructive and try to keep a cool head. If you are dissatisfied, then look for the cause within yourself first. It does not take a prophet to foretell that your life will bring romantic disappointments with it and you should not let frustration carry you away to the point where you give in to self-destructive tendencies."
258;RADIX_0000000008405186;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;"It is difficult for you to show your emotions and admit to your vulnerability. In living together with others, you make the same mistakes over and over again and find it difficult to learn new behavior. Relationships can be robbed of their happiness by your inclination to chase after ideals and avoid confronting the problems of reality. It may be that you have sacrificed your entire identity and all your personal goals for someone else thinking that this is love.



Extreme sensitivity can leave you feeling attacked in situations when no one intended to hurt you. Until you have found inner harmony and have learned to judge relationships realistically, you will have to deal with disappointments. Honest affection can only develop when it stems from an open heart."
259;RADIX_0000000009191618;Your Venus in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"During the course of your life you will encounter difficulties creatively expressing your personality. For this reason, misunderstandings are inevitable. Sometimes you are unable to tell what kind of people you are dealing with and are a poor judge of their real motives. Maybe you idolize people who have not earned your trust, and are then forced to deal with disappointments. For this reason, you should try to conduct your relationships more realistically. Although you radiate self-confidence, on the inside you are very dependent on the approval of others and prefer to be around people who you feel have already made it.



Maybe the next time you see your reflection in the mirror, you should make it understand that you are ok. Of course this development may take some time."
260;RADIX_0000000009453762;Your Venus in Opposition with Your MC;"Possibly your childhood was such that you did not grow up in a warm and loving atmosphere. This may be the cause of your problems projecting your professional self-image. There may be communication problems at work, or you may be accused of a lack of taste.



It is also possible that responsibilities are transferred to you from your closest friends, which get in the way of an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying love life. Still, this serves only as a challenge, which can be overcome in this lifetime with a little discipline and willingness to compromise."
261;RADIX_0000000001081538;Your Venus in Square with Your Mars;"This aspect may cause emotional problems especially in your partnership because your potential for love and aggression do not harmonize with each other. Sometimes you behave as if the only purpose for a partnership were to satisfy your sexual desires, an attitude that upsets your partner. Maybe you should work on developing tact and get a grip on your instincts in order to take better care of yourself.



Although you are emotionally very sensitive, this does not necessarily make you aware of the vulnerability of the people around you. This can cause conflicts and other difficulties.



Possibly, Venus' ever-present desire to preserve harmony has prevented you from developing assertiveness and from setting clear limits. In this case, you should try to direct your vision on your goals and do not make any detours for the purpose of avoiding conflicts."
262;RADIX_0000000001343682;Your Venus in Square with Your Jupiter;Possibly you value comfort and meaningless social conventions so much that others find you superficial. Often, you pretend to be able to do things that you are not actually capable of. If you do not watch out, you will give people a false impression of yourself. Maybe you ask for more than you are able to give. You will not exactly make friends that way. Come back down to Earth and face reality. Do not overdo your love of luxury. It is important to watch your weight because of your love of eating. As a female, you may be proud of your looks and your social status and may do anything to attract attention. Avoid excesses and try to lead a stable life. If you can bring yourself to take on more responsibility for your life, it would improve your future perspectives.
263;RADIX_0000000001605826;Your Venus in Square with Your Saturn;People may sometimes get the impression that you are depressed because you are not sure which position in life you should take. This is why you are inhibited in expressing your feelings which are inhibited by shyness or a reserved nature. Possibly you have experienced disappointments and defeats since your early childhood, and your desire to be loved and respected were not necessarily fulfilled to your satisfaction. Take care that you do not turn into a cynic who holds everybody but himself responsible for his fate. This does not imply that you are opposed to working by your own interests.  Especially when it concerns material goods, you can act extremely selfish. Instead, look towards the positive side of life, get out and meet people, then you will be better able to expect something for yourself.
264;RADIX_0000000001867970;Your Venus in Square with Your Uranus;"There are times when you change lovers at the rate that other people change their socks. There is passion as you are falling in love that does not usually last very long. Maybe you are attracted to people of the same sex or have an unconventional sex life. It is important for you to learn that a long-lasting relationship requires giving up a small part of your autonomy because it is not workable without compromises. When you are feeling insecure, like you are on an emotional roller coaster, you should pay attention not to let yourself go too far or you will hurt others. On a social level, exciting activities may come up which you do not always quite follow. Do not take on too much; remember that you are not responsible for the well being of all of humanity. Even if your activities are praiseworthy, you probably load yourself down too much."
265;RADIX_0000000002130114;Your Venus in Square with Your Neptune;"This aspect can cause problems because you receive signals from your subconscious, which have no bearing to reality and can disillusion you. Possibly emotional and sexual problems hidden deep within you are destined to emerge out of your past and suddenly come to light. Escape mechanisms send you into a dream world to avoid confronting the demands of life in reality. For this reason, you should abstain from taking any kind of drugs.



In erotic affairs, you are not very particular and tend to get involved in questionable relationships, which can also involve risky financial enterprises. If you are not open and honest in your relationships they will be endangered.



Other people perceive you as being shy and introverted, but you are capable of having secret love affairs, which can occasionally lead to sexual excesses. Seen positively you are creative and have good taste. With the necessary discipline you could be able to put these abilities to use. Sometimes you can be over-sensitive and make yourself vulnerable."
266;RADIX_0000000002392258;Your Venus in Square with Your Pluto;"In your emotional, in depth and even dramatic experiences with sexuality you try not to let yourself be dragged down to lower levels of your subconsciousness. Possibly you act on your passions and are not capable of letting logic take over, even when it seems to be necessary. Interference from supernatural authorities could also get in the way of a happy relationship.



Do not let your wish for material goods become dominant or let your way of dealing with others take on an inconsiderate nature. In all your relationships, money can play a deciding role, although this way of thinking will not get you anywhere. If you have supernatural powers, do not use them in an egotistical way to manipulate your surroundings, especially members of the opposite sex. Instead, invest your talents in the creation of innovative forms of art, this will bring you positive energy as well as the recognition from others."
267;RADIX_0000000008421570;Your Venus in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;"You often put everything you have got into renewing your relationship to others in order to find satisfaction. Inner tranquillity may lead you to misjudge situations and get yourself into embarrassing situations. Thus, what you are looking for can only develop slowly. It requires tact and sensitivity in dealing with other people's vulnerability. In the field of diplomacy, you still have a lot to learn and should do so if you intend to develop further and become satisfied.



Maybe you have unrealistic expectations of living with others and are shocked when a conflict has to be solved or if an argument breaks out. Remind yourself that life cannot always be harmonious and that confrontations can be fruitful experiences."
268;RADIX_0000000009208002;Your Venus in Square with Your Ascendant;"During the course of your life you will encounter difficulties creatively expressing your personality. For this reason, misunderstandings are inevitable. It may be that you have strong ties to your parents. Some people may think that your laziness drives you to live in a state of dependency that does not allow you to live your own life.



Find the courage to take action, because as a master of grand words, you will eventually be judged by your deeds. If they are unsatisfactory, then it is time to rethink things. Invest more energy in managing your life, if you are interested in making something out of it. Usually your exaggerated need for harmony leads you to avoid conflicts, even those that could be productive. However, in order to make this kind of statement, it is necessary to take the entire chart into consideration."
269;RADIX_0000000009470146;Your Venus in Square with Your MC;"Possibly your childhood was such that you did not grow up in a warm and loving atmosphere. This may be the cause of your problems projecting your professional self-image. There may be communication problems at work, or you may be accused of a lack of taste.



It is also possible that responsibilities are transferred to you from your closest friends, which get in the way of an emotionally and aesthetically satisfying love life. Still, this only serves as a challenge that can be overcome in this lifetime, with a little discipline and willingness to compromise."
270;RADIX_0000000001097922;Your Venus in Trine with Your Mars;"This aspect could make it easier for you to realize your dreams. Life is fun and your erotic radiance attracts people magnetically, especially members of the opposite sex, unless other challenging factors in your chart cancel out this quality. As long as this is not the case, it will be easy for you to have intense and long-lasting relationships with members of the opposite sex. The sensitivity of Venus combines with Mars' strength to give you dynamic expression, while Venus softens Mars' potential for aggression.



You know that you appeal to other people's emotions. Your creative talent, especially in the areas of music and art, is pronounced allowing you to work towards an adequate expression of your talents."
271;RADIX_0000000001360066;Your Venus in Trine with Your Jupiter;"As an optimist, you love all of life's pleasures and are very creative. Maybe you have a special interest in history of art and express yourself in art, philosophy and ethics. Your relationships are generally harmonious and peaceful. Professionally, you may deal with art and/or nutrition. Because you enjoy decorating your home and can offer useful suggestions for alterations on the apartments of your friends, you could turn your technical talents and talent for drawing into a career as an interior decorator. If you overcome your inhibitions and experience the joy of singing, you will find that your voice is warm and melodious.



This aspect provides you with the ability to please others, whereby you can show a great deal of understanding for people plagued by misfortune. Sensitivity and refined manners are largely responsible for your popularity."
272;RADIX_0000000001622210;Your Venus in Trine with Your Saturn;"The astounding creative talent that you have been given could be used in the pursuit of your ambitions. Friends and relatives appreciate you for your loyalty and reliability. You should be capable of making long-lasting friendships because you value the work you invest in relationships. What you want most is to live happily at your partner's side, which includes working together to realize your mutual creative ambitions. 



In the course of your life you have recognized that pure egotism will not fulfill your wishes, and that you can sacrifice your own personal advantages for the sake of others. In society, you appear cultivated and charming since constantly expanding on your general education is important to you. Professional success will enable you to live comfortably on an adequate retirement fund. The simple lifestyle you prefer will help you to realize this with little effort."
273;RADIX_0000000001884354;Your Venus in Trine with Your Uranus;"Through positive thinking you enjoy life to its fullest. A feeling of mutual affection and respect is what bonds you to others, still you notice when someone is trying to deceive you and can react accordingly. When people try to abuse your good will and generosity it hurts.



People around you can profit from your sense of justice and your optimism. You enjoy taking on responsibility in this area. Intuitively, you know that harmonious energies you are sending out will return to you with a positive effect for everyone.



Pleasure with aesthetics and your clear sensitivity enable you to recognize the value of beauty and harmony. If you are able to become creatively involved in art, music or theater, then nothing will stand in the way of your happiness. You like to work in areas where you come into contact with lots of people because you receive constant confirmation that people like being around you."
274;RADIX_0000000002146498;Your Venus in Trine with Your Neptune;"A sensitive nature will help you to use your creative abilities during the course of your life in a way that will benefit both you and your environment. At times you let your romantic side strive for high ideals. Good taste for art and music enables you to satisfy yourself creatively. Eloquence has become a useful tool in your endeavors to teach young people about the foundations of the beautiful things in life.



In judging your environment you take your time and consider things carefully. You are able to remain calm and friendly even when your are disappointed repeatedly. Due to your large heart, you are of the opinion that forgiveness should play an important part in people's lives. Still, if things get too tense for you, withdraw to a quieter place because you cannot handle too much negativity.



Creative potential will always play a role. Either you will assert yourself in an especially creative manner or let it go completely, whereby it is a shame to waste your talents."
275;RADIX_0000000002408642;Your Venus in Trine with Your Pluto;"An intense love life and diverse relationships in your surroundings will be to your intellectual benefit. In addition, you are able to motivate people who have been discouraged by unhappy relationships to give love another chance. Once you have found the right partner, you will allow your passions free reign and find an irresistible way of keeping your partner. You will try to take your love to such heights that no earthly power will be able to separate you.



No matter which path in life you choose, you can always count on adequate compensation for your efforts. This type of universal love, which has an influence on everything you do, will make your life pleasant and comfortable. It may even reach a point where your efforts result in a substantial inheritance.



Faith in your own abilities and on those of other people is your greatest asset. Because you are always honest and correct, you will certainly never cause anyone in your circles any harm. A talent for dealing with money and other resources may lead to a job in this area. Flattery does not impress you because you prefer to make judgements based on your experiences with human nature."
276;RADIX_0000000008437954;Your Venus in Trine with Your Northern Moon Node;"A positive basis lets you approach life in a way in which you profit from the help of other people. Although you could have the tendency to take things as they come and often miss out on opportunities due to laziness, you are currently satisfied with your life and do not necessarily want to reach the top.

As attractive as you are, this should be no problem. 



A feeling for the true value of your successes prevents you from becoming arrogant. If at some point one of your wishes is denied, try to control yourself and do not be insulted.

278;RADIX_0000000009486530;Your Venus in Trine with Your MC;"This aspect enables you to approach your professional life skillfully, and also structure private relationships well. From early on, your parents encouraged you and you probably had a very happy childhood. Today, you are well balanced, which your colleagues and employers appreciate, and which ensures a satisfying love life.



Venus is responsible for all the nice things in life, which may make it possible for you to go into an artistic profession. Possibly you work in an Art Gallery or are involved with publishing art of some kind. Your home is probably decorated tastefully, whereby you have a special relationship to your houseplants."
279;RADIX_0000000001114306;Your Venus in Sextile with Your Mars;"You should be able to live a contented life, especially in a fulfilling partnership with lots of giving and receiving. You are a good person, still you appear determined and set limits when necessary. Generally, you appear open and joyful. Because Mars always has some connection to sports while Venus represents aesthetics, you may get involved in dance or in rhythmic gymnastics.

Your charming personality makes you good at selling the things you are convinced of. This may make you wealthy. Take care that you are not too generous. You have a tendency to lavish both your feelings and your possessions on others."

283;RADIX_0000000002162882;Your Venus in Sextile with Your Neptune;Make an effort to integrate creativity into your everyday life. Neptune is frequently referred to as the higher octave of Venus, which on the one hand can be expressed in a holistic creative expression, or can enable you to show both other people and your environment great respect and sympathy.

An understanding of universal equilibrium and harmony makes it easy for you to grasp the creative foundation and express it verbally. Pluto always goes deeper allowing you to direct your professional interests toward research and the natural sciences. Once you have found a position that is right for you, the creative and pleasant side of Venus will blossom."

Today, you are well balanced, which your colleagues and employers appreciate, and which ensures a satisfying love life.



Venus is responsible for all the nice things in life, which may make it possible for you to go into an artistic profession. Possibly you work in an art gallery or are involved with publishing art of some kind. Your home is probably decorated tastefully, whereby you have a special relationship to your houseplants."
288;RADIX_0000000000000198;Your Venus in the First House;"Venus in this area of your chart speaks for an openness in life. You feel a desire to enter new friendships giving your sensitivity and friendliness a free run.



If you encourage inner harmony and flexibility, you will find out who you are, although a possible outcome is a feeling of internal conflict due to your need to respond to the expectations of others. You should make an effort to really like yourself. Self-assurance and self-confidence are essential to satisfying relationships. If you respect yourself this will have a positive effect on your surroundings and you will find it easier to accept other people the way they are.



Venus in the first house can be interpreted as contributing to an aesthetically pleasing appearance. Even if you are not considered ""conventionally beautiful"" others find you charming and attractive.



Hopefully you did not give in to your longing for comfort too much while you were growing up. You may enjoy sitting in your favorite armchair and waiting for things to happen without having to invest any effort. It would be better for you to get up and take an initiative.



If Venus is harmoniously aspected then you received a good education that gave you self-confidence and a positive attitude towards life."
289;RADIX_0000000000016582;Your Venus in the Second House;"Venus in the house of material values provides you with an inclination to acquire all the material possessions that please you. This enables you to decorate your surroundings according to your personal taste. This does not imply that you feel compelled to follow every trend, quite the opposite: you love the timeless classics and have an eye for quality. You love to be praised for this. Naturally there is some danger of drifting off into a dream world of aesthetics which shields you from confrontation with the ugly reality. A simple way to avoid this is by reading the daily paper.



You are polite and objective enough to feel at home in a diplomatic environment. Your character will probably allow you to get a hold of everything you need or value. If you learn to plan of your finances instead of wasting money indiscriminately you will have no financial problems. You should have a lot of artistic creativity. You are especially talented at forming natural materials with your hands. You may be able to make this into your profession."
290;RADIX_0000000000032966;Your Venus in the Third House;"You are open to the needs of others, especially in conversations your sensibility enables you to find just the right words. Watch out that you do not conform your ideals to the point of restricting your individual expression. You love a good conversation and want to be in line with the person you are talking to, whereby you find an aggressive tone very intimidating.



Most people are very friendly to you, because a pleasant atmosphere moves you. If you have siblings, it would be strange if you were not in close contact to them, unless Venus is challengingly aspected in this house.



You probably experienced school as a joyful time of acquiring abilities. Words and numbers interest you because you have always approached learning playfully and still do. You feel a longing to devote time to deepen your general education and would like to express yourself in an artistic medium. Your talent for dealing with differing situations and social classes could be of help to you."
291;RADIX_0000000000049350;Your Venus in the Fourth House;"You long for peace and tranquillity in your family. You cannot stand conflicts and always try to work out a solution. To promote this you have created a relaxed home which you enjoy redecorating periodically. Be aware that open conflicts are a part of family life. It is better to confront them than to have undercurrents of concealed aggression, which are not permitted to rise above the harmonious surface.



Venus stands in relation to the images you have made of the central people in your life or your views of everything which you find beautiful. Your mother may have provoked this projection onto herself. Earlier, she may have made you feel competitive or distrustful because you felt that you could never get close to her. If you are male, you may have fallen in love with your mother and made your father your rival.



You are capable of changing this because Venus in the fourth house is an indication that your family has a good financial and emotional standing. Even in your old age, you will not have to worry because you will have the financial means to live the way you want to. You may be one of the fortunate who had an artistic influence in their childhood."
292;RADIX_0000000000065734;Your Venus in the Fifth House;"You long to express your perceptions and ideas in a creative medium and should go ahead and do it in order to preserve your inner harmony. In unpleasant moments, following your imagination and artistically expressing your emotions especially helps to clear your thoughts. Unless a challenging aspect to other planets prevents it, the expression of your individuality and your radiance should touch those around you.



Love may be the most important thing in life for you. You can take pleasure in romance like no one else, although it may include tragic situations. Sometimes you do not take it as seriously as you should because the fifth house is the house of play.



You also like to go to cultural events such as exhibits or concerts, because you can meet people and like to be seen.



A harmonious aspect to the planet Venus in this house can allow you to have fun with children even if they are not your own. As a parent you will always encourage your children's talents. Just do not make the mistake of projecting your determination onto your children."
293;RADIX_0000000000082118;Your Venus in the Sixth House;"The sixth house stands for our daily responsibilities, health and hygiene, whereas Venus brings joy and harmony. For you this means that you do not shirk your responsibilities, but thoroughly enjoy spring-cleaning. It is possible that you will meet your partner at work. Guard yourself against an excess occupation with details. Stay open for pleasures that have nothing to do with responsibilities. Other people see this positively and notice the joy with which you serve and take on people needing help.



With the planet Venus in the sixth house you enjoy expanding on your skills and perfecting your qualities. It is not enough just to do a job; you also want to meet practical and aesthetic standards.



You have the capacity to live in harmony with your body. If health problems should arise, it will be due to your unhealthy habits and poor diet."
294;RADIX_0000000000098502;Your Venus in the Seventh House;"With the planet Venus in the seventh house you will try to satisfy your need for a harmonious environment by staying in touch with the people you love. You find your ideal of beauty in your closest friends and can completely identify with whomever you are talking to. Sometimes you approach people out of a fear of being alone. You experience deep satisfaction and happiness only by sacrificing yourself for your relationship. This provides you with the approval you need to recognize your talents.



If you love someone you will help her to develop her qualities and become important to her. Simultaneously, you will have higher expectations than anyone has a realistic chance of meeting. You are responsible for your own disappointments. Make more of an effort to avoid putting pressure on your partner and to think before you criticize. No love affair is all sunshine. You are going to have to learn to accept burdens and restrictions as part of a happy relationship.



The seventh house characterizes your social context. With Venus in this position in your chart, you are going to need to surround yourself with style and good taste."
295;RADIX_0000000000114886;Your Venus in the Eighth House;"You love coordinating human relationships and want to have good experiences with others. If you ever get the chance to enter the business world, do not hesitate to go for it because acquiring material possessions is favored in this Venus position. You may also come to wealth through marriage.



You have a talent for opening people up through provocation. This makes you popular and respected and also makes people want to confide in you. It is not improbable that they will show their appreciation financially.



In erotic matters, you will confuse your partners with your unusual art of seduction. But do not make the mistake of using sex as an instrument of power."
296;RADIX_0000000000131270;Your Venus in the Ninth House;"Venus in the ninth house brings you into confrontation with the meaning of life, less on a theoretical level than as a way of dealing with your experiences. This provides a philosophical background for your openness and joy of life.



You love to travel. If life does not grant you ample opportunity, you should devote more energy to it. You experience rituals of other cultures in full awareness and enjoy the vibrant colors of life represented on the various continents. You may fall in love in a foreign country, where an exciting adventure awaits you. Or you may begin a relationship with a foreigner or someone you met while traveling.



Your professional interests are generally in education. You have no problem guiding your students because you are always emotionally involved. Your view of the world is expressed in all your activities.



If Venus is harmoniously aspected in the ninth house, you will be tactful in dealing with others and have a good sense of judgment."
297;RADIX_0000000000147654;Your Venus in the Tenth House;"The tenth house will make it clear exactly how you intend to present yourself. Because you always try to make a good impression and want to keep your favorable position, one will not catch you out on the street in your slippers. You want to be recognized and prefer work that allows for self-expression. The fashion or entertainment industries may offer you possibilities. In any job you will emphasize a peaceful work environment and good relations with your colleagues. It would be best if you could go into business for yourself. You would be in control and could do the work you most enjoy. Of course, this is everybody's dream. Venus' aspects in this house will tell you more about your chances of making it.



You should have had a loving relationship with your father and he probably influenced your taste and love of harmony. If you worshipped him as a boy, you may feel inadequate, untalented and clumsy next to him or you may compete with him. As a female, your father may have been the first love of your life."
298;RADIX_0000000000164038;Your Venus in the Eleventh House;"Venus in the eleventh house indicates that you are people oriented. You are able to contribute to any group experience and to profit from it. Challenging aspects to Venus in this house will tell you if problems may arise. A love of cultural events compels you to devote yourself completely to social life. But watch out that you do not overdo it. You may project your views on aesthetic or compassion onto your friendships or groups. You feel good about yourself only when you have found the right group. Maybe you will try to further your career by joining a group that promises to be useful. Groups devoted to improving the world interest you the most.



You can do a lot for your friendships and group activities; you should not be disappointed if your enthusiasm is not matched by others and if your friends do not live up to your expectations."
299;RADIX_0000000000180422;Your Venus in the Twelfth House;"With Venus in the twelfth house you will often find yourself in solitude, which is just the way you like it. Peace and quiet arouses your creativity and gives you your best ideas. You may prefer to keep your love affairs out of the public eye. 



You long for a beauty beyond reach which promises ideal fulfillment. You will look for love and beauty in someone else and then submit completely in the relationship. You expect a lot from your lover and harbor a feeling deep within you that you are missing something if you give your love only to one person. This may express itself in an elevation of your love to a higher level that allows you to share your love with more than just one other person by loving all of creation and sacrificing yourself. Potential lovers can then only be of secondary importance.



On the physical level, Venus tells of the relation to specific institutions. You may work in a gallery, a museum, a hospital, a home for the elderly or a similar institution."
300;RADIX_0000000000000260;Mars - The Will to Survive;Mars orbits the Sun in 687 days. It is smaller than the earth and has a diameter of 6800 kilometers. It is known for its red color that has always been associated with aggression. For this reason Mars is honored as the god of war, called Ares by the Greeks, who was renown for his courage and bravery and threw himself into every battle. Traditionally, Mars symbolizes the warrior who has to till the fields in time of peace to feed his family. Mars symbolizes the male and Venus personifies the female energy. Fortunately, it is becoming increasingly difficult to work with these outdated concepts in Astrology. It makes more sense to equate Mars with our energy drive, which both men and women posses in some form. Thus, Mars stands for assertiveness, drive, aggression, courage and also for sex drive. Mars rules the sign Aries as well as together with Pluto, the sign Scorpio.
301;RADIX_0000000000000257;Your Mars in Aries;"Mars in Aries turns you into a bundle of energy. Mars gives you power and helps you to get a grip on your goals. You have a lot of ideas and do not hesitate to realize them. Unfortunately, you often do not have enough endurance to work through to the end; halfway there you get interested in another project. You let yourself get excited and can get others caught up in your enthusiasm. You do not let anyone tell you what to do or even offer well meant suggestions. You want to do things your own way, are usually in a hurry and overlook important details. This means you have to deal with failure on occasion. It would pay to work more carefully and plan and organize your activities before you begin. You should tame your enthusiasm and pay more attention to the feelings of others. Your thoughtlessness can hurt others. You are sometimes angry and even aggressive.



You measure yourself against your competitors. You need a lot of exercise and have the qualities of a good athlete. Maybe you channel your excess energies into sex, because your drive can be overpowering. Your determination to be active can be very useful in life. You should watch out that you do not end up alone at the top."
302;RADIX_0000000000016641;Your Mars in Taurus;"Your drive in life comes from your desire to gain material control. You have a way with finances, a full bank account is important to your feeling of security. You work long and hard and acquire wealth to enjoy your retirement later in life. If Mars has an unfavorable aspect, you could overdo it turning into a greedy miser.



You make long term plans and apply your energy sensibly. Your goals are realistic and always attainable. You have no desire to waste your time on nonsense. You prefer to see tangible results. It is important to live an orderly life, but do not hold back when it comes to celebrating your successes. There is certainly no lack of joy in your life. This combination makes you popular because you are responsible and always willing to help.



You have a well-balanced character and do not let yourself be provoked. Whenever it does happen, your opponent should watch out that he or she does not get trampled. You are prepared to prove your determination without holding anything back."
303;RADIX_0000000000033025;Your Mars in Gemini;"It is no problem for you to approach strangers. You always want to know what is going on because you have learned that knowledge is power. There is hardly a topic which does not interest you and about which you do not have something to say. You love a heated discussion and do not back away from conflicts. A good fight can even bring you into your best form. Your quick retorts make you unbeatable in discussions; you should listen to the arguments of your opponents more carefully and not resort to unfair means such as sarcasm. You may say things, which you regret later. Some things cannot be fixed with an apology. It is better if you keep your tongue in check.



You spend a lot of energy collecting information for your general education. If you work in the media, your creativity will make you very successful. It would do you good to reduce your interests to a single area, at least for a limited time; otherwise you may end up tired, out of breath and with nothing to show for your efforts."
304;RADIX_0000000000049409;Your Mars in Cancer;"The planet Mars is uncomfortable in Cancer because Cancer stands in opposition to the sign Capricorn, where Mars likes to relax. It is not easy to express your Martian energies in this position because the planet Mars and the sign Cancer have fundamentally different forms of energy. If you find it difficult to get your way, you may admire the courage and determination other people are in command of. As a man, you may be amazed by your strong feminine character traits. Use your sensitivity to overcome the aggressive, empty, self-serving ambitions which other men find fascinating and cannot live without. Do not underestimate women's appreciation of your strengths. Men with Mars in Cancer make the tenderest lovers. Men who do not manage to free themselves from empty macho pretensions, are only making fools of themselves. 



A woman with Mars in this position on her chart will be attracted to men with warmth and sensitivity who are romantic. You prefer to see a man cry than watch him sweat lifting weights. Nothing turns you off faster than a macho idiot strutting his stuff. You need someone who will sit with you in front of the fireplace and talk about having children."
305;RADIX_0000000000065793;Your Mars in Leo;"The planet Mars in Leo gives you an enormous energy potential. You are willing and able to express your creative talents. You like to tell other people what to do. Most do not object because they respect your authority. Be careful not to go too far, or you will find that you do not have any friends and are left surrounded by lackeys.



You have great confidence and know how to put yourself in a good light. You may have a talent for acting; astrological research shows that many actors and actresses have Mars in Leo. You like to keep active and especially enjoy doing things with children. You do not lack determination; once you have decided on a goal you can work on it with perseverance, especially if it increases your popularity. You should ask yourself what you are doing in response to your own needs and what is merely show for others.



You probably have a strong sex drive that expresses itself in romances and affairs. You are capable of passionate feelings. As a man you can tend to gestures of machismo, which can seem exaggerated. Your task will be to keep your conceit under control and be more humble."
306;RADIX_0000000000082177;Your Mars in Virgo;"You intend to use your energies to fulfill your responsibilities to everyone's satisfaction, if not above and beyond their satisfaction. Your endurance and practical skills can bring you great success, but you should watch out that you do not become too much of a perfectionist and automatically measure others by your own standards. You love to work on details and will choose a career in which precision is necessary. You may work in the health field because Virgo is associated with the body and with health.



Your weakness is for the natural sciences, especially for math. You may be a skillful crafts artisan. You do not rush into anything, but have your temperament well under control and are aware that great tasks require thorough preparation. You may miss out on attractive opportunities because you hesitate and weigh the risks too long. You could risk allowing yourself to be a little more spontaneous. Those around you will be happy for you.



You work to improve the conditions at work, and although your employer appreciates your sense of responsibility, you may have problems with your colleagues because you insist that you can do everything better."
307;RADIX_0000000000098561;Your Mars in Libra;"You are not striving toward egotistical goals because in Libra, Mars is in the sign of human relationships. This is why the approval of your group is so important to you in every endeavor. You do not work alone, but prefer to work towards a noble goal as part of a team. You may even fight for the causes of others more than your own. You will have to decide for yourself if this is always a positive characteristic.



You feel insecure on your own, but when you have the feeling of being accepted and are able to do something for someone else, you can tap more energy. You work for equality, justice and peace. You can bring energy into a relationship and usually play the more active part. You have a lot of enjoyment in an active sex life and frequently surprise your partner with small gifts. You also like to beautify your environment and demonstrate good taste in this regard. 



If Mars has a challenging aspect, you may appear too dominant in social situations or have a lot of problems in partnerships."
308;RADIX_0000000000114945;Your Mars in Scorpio;"In Scorpio, Mars can reach its potential more powerfully than in any other sign. You have to learn to use this energy in a sensible way, or it will be put into the wrong directions that can have grievous consequences. You are able to build and destroy as you please and are not free from self-destructive tendencies. You set your ambitions high and want everything or nothing. Mediocrity and moderation are not for you. Your unusual charm will always make people notice you. No risk is too high and no path too dangerous, because you love challenges and are always out to prove your strength. 



The person who becomes your enemy has no enviable position. You show no mercy and are unforgiving. You fight until the end, whereby all means are justified. If Mars has an unfavorable aspect you can be unscrupulous and egotistical, refusing to acknowledge when you have reached a limit. If you have learned from experience and have become more mature you will use your energy to help others and do everything to help the destitute back on their feet.



Sexuality plays a large role in your life. Your energy can be expressed more clearly in this area. Do not let your passions devour you and accept the end of a relationship without seeking revenge."
309;RADIX_0000000000131329;Your Mars in Sagittarius;"Mars in Sagittarius gives you a strong ethical perspective. You want to continue your education and if possible travel to distant lands in order to expand your horizons and reach important conclusions. You are a seeker and an adventurer. You go through life with optimism and joy. You do not bother yourself with details, but leave them to others. Your projects are usually grand and extravagant, but serve worthy causes.



You can work fanatically for your convictions. For this reason, you should take care not to get on the nerves of those around you. You may hurt others by overdoing your love of truth.



Generally, you are popular and are known for your fairness and openness. Sometimes you are like a kid who has just discovered her environment and goes out on an exploratory adventure. You can be high spirited and play practical jokes, which will be forgiven because nobody can stay mad at you. You feel in tune with nature and need a lot of exercise. According to classical Astrology, you are supposed to love horses and like to ride."
310;RADIX_0000000000147713;Your Mars in Capricorn;"You invest your energy in professional success in order to gain a prestigious position in society. You are not concerned with reaching your goals as quickly as possible, but to stand on firm ground. You take your time and concentrate on your tasks. You work your way up with persistence and determination. If you are successful in reaching a goal you proceed according to plan allowing no temptations to distract you. From an early age you knew what you wanted to achieve in life and also learned to accept responsibility for your actions. You want to keep your independence and see tangible results. You remove any barriers in your way without causing a stir.



If Mars has a negative aspect, your determination can win out making your climb to the top at any cost, regardless of whom it hurts. You can look down on the less successful and show little regard for the feelings of others. You will probably feel very lonely once you reach the top.



You should learn in the course of your life that success and money are not everything and kindness should not be lost on the way."
311;RADIX_0000000000164097;Your Mars in Aquarius;"You try to avoid following directions preferring to go your own way. Your independence is important to you. You will never let yourself be chained up. Even if you are actively trying to improve the situation of others and your friendships have real meaning, they never go beyond the point that could endanger your independence. You need freedom and will always take full responsibility for your failures.



You prefer intellectual work that gives you an opportunity to prove your originality and is not limited by restrictions. Your greatest feats do not necessarily have to be undertaken in your career; your free time is just as important to you. You stay in contact to a lot of people and feel best when working on a project with people with the same convictions. You prefer teamwork and know how much can be achieved by working together. You are not one to accept traditional methods uncritically. You are by nature critical and want to make your own experiences. You are always open for new ideas, whereby you are convinced that now is the time for the unity of humanity and that there is no alternative available to the world. You work towards justice and to incorporate kindness into the plan for our future society."
312;RADIX_0000000000180481;Your Mars in Pisces;"Mars may feel uncomfortable in Pisces, here it will be difficult to find a concrete goal and prove determination. Your energies can vary leaving you feeling exhausted, broken and powerless one day, and wanting to uproot trees the next day. Your strength is dependent on your emotional situation. For this reason, you should practice positive thinking and avoid self-pity and depressing thoughts as much as possible.



You try to avoid public appearances and prefer working anonymously letting others bask in the limelight. You may be the helpful, sensitive soul who keeps everything functioning and goes unnoticed until she is no longer there. You do not ask for recognition, although it does you good and can draw you out of isolation. You do not believe in yourself and your abilities. You sell yourself under value and avoid any conflict. You should learn to defend your position and fight for your interests. Once you have experienced success in this area, your large heart and endless sensitivity will help you to do good deeds and selflessly help others."
313;RADIX_0000000001310978;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Jupiter;"Great energy reserves allow you to work hard for everything that is important to you, such as continuing your general education. The knowledge you gain is put to use in the various social projects you are working on. This conjunction lets you believe in what you are doing because you have great faith in your power to reach any goal you set for yourself.



If you are ever involved in a profession requiring motivation and business sense, this aspect will help you to gain the trust of your boss and colleagues. Just do not overdo it or you may bite off more than you can chew."
314;RADIX_0000000001573122;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Saturn;"You should be in a position to succeed in your profession and be able to find a solution to the most complex problems. Accustomed to getting by with little, this aspect will support activities that require humility but at the same time a deep sense of responsibility. Colleagues who do less than you do quickly earn your contempt.



Still these limitations can also have a negative effect and let frustration cause you to lose control over your behavior. You may feel that your self-expression is being suffocated and may have difficulty keeping your aggressive potential under control, so that it can erupt without warning. Dissatisfaction can develop into a dogmatic and authoritarian attitude. Relax and treat yourself to something enjoyable once in a while. That is healthier than going through life embittered."
315;RADIX_0000000001835266;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Uranus;"This aspect denotes the tendency to passionately rush into things, since your freedom means everything to you. Any kind of restriction or coercion makes you rebel. Boredom has no place in your life. You are always looking for new challenges and adventures. You advance quickly, throwing caution to the wind. It is imperative that you take more care of yourself or you could burn out. Relaxation could also be important for you to renew your energy. It would do your nerves and your body a lot of good to regularly go to a sauna.



You are fascinated by modern technology and new developments in the aerodynamics and information technology and follow all the developments with great interest. It would be satisfying for you to work in a technical field and preferably in the area of electronics. If you let your many activities drive you to hectic behavior, this could lead to a tragic accident, which could be avoided by taking time out for a little reflection. Watch out for your reckless driving behavior and try to keep yourself under control."
316;RADIX_0000000002097410;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Neptune;"This aspect may bring you extrasensory powers that you will be able to use in support of the less fortunate. Astrology may be an interesting field of study for you, although you may see it as a way to come to terms with the meaning of your own self. A profound spirituality resides within you, which you should handle carefully. It may be that until now your plans have been impractical and useless. If this is the case then you can easily get lost in your endeavors.



Often, people find your actions incomprehensible and some people have no idea how they should deal with you. In your erotic relationships, you often sense desires which even you think are strange. Because you have difficulty perceiving reality as it is, you should avoid mind-altering substances."
317;RADIX_0000000002359554;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Pluto;"Large energy reserves serve you well in a variety of activities. Due to your spirituality you are able to tap into cosmic energy sources. Sometimes you take on more stress than others do, whereby you also end up with more to harvest. Courage and your extreme willpower can get you into dangerous situations, which you tend to enjoy.



How this conjunction expresses itself depends on which planet has a dominant position in your chart. If it is Mars, you will have to keep your passion in check, because it can express itself in an unhealthy egotism. If during the course of your life you become more aware of the meaning of your role in the universe and are able to see beyond your national identity, you should also understand Pluto's principle of will and be able to offer your strength to help others."
318;RADIX_0000000008388866;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;"With all your energy, you charge into life and pursue your goals with a fighting spirit, conquering anything that gets in your way. In spite of your ability to assert yourself, you find it difficult to compromise and show consideration for others. Also in erotic affairs your participation is enthusiastic and you love to boast about your adventures. Satisfy your need to let off steam in athletic competition. Taking part in a team sport may do you good.



If you can find no other way, you completely break out and start over again, because you are not afraid of the unknown. For you life is a challenge that you are more than ready to take on. Avoid abusing your strengths and you are sure to be successful."
319;RADIX_0000000009175298;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"Being loaded with energy and always trying to leave an impression, you may go so far as to meddle in other people's affairs. This will not always be to your advantage.



It is important for you to act with caution and to avoid rushing into things. A little patience at the right time and place can have a tremendous advantage on your energetic potential. It will not get you anywhere if people decide to avoid you because of your hot-headedness. Even if you find it difficult you should get used to accepting compromises; people will thank you for it."
320;RADIX_0000000009437442;Your Mars in Conjunction with Your MC;"The determination by which you are driven in your professional affairs astounds many people. You always come out on top and your colleagues have accepted that your endeavors have substance, even if some of them are put off. Experience has shown that it is best to get out of the way of your scramble to the top.



Classically, this Mars position is associated with a military career; today this interpretation is not taken so strictly since peoples' attitudes toward the military have changed. Probably you are athletic and may well work with powerful machines."
321;RADIX_0000000001327362;Your Mars in Opposition with Your Jupiter;"See to it that you get a grip on your wasteful habits, especially when it comes to dealing with other people's financial resources. At first, you seem to be nice and are always polite, but egotistical motives can be lurking underneath this facade. Much of what you do is actually aimed to serve your own interests.



On occasion, you can push your global and social convictions on people around you so aggressively that you intimidate others. If you feel urges to take a trip, go ahead and do it. It will satisfy your thirst for adventure and expand your horizon. Do not get taken in by risky business enterprises. Check up on the people that you are dealing with, even if making a quick buck is tempting."
322;RADIX_0000000001589506;Your Mars in Opposition with Your Saturn;"In the course of your life, you will often feel like you have been treated unfairly and feel compelled to demonstrate that you have not lost your assertiveness by giving in to temper tantrums or acts of violence to compensate for your sense of inferiority. If you have already let this become a habit, then do not be surprised if people do not flock to support you in your efforts to reach your goals.



Possibly your childhood was marred by conflicts with your parents, whereby one of your parents took on a dominant role and had no tolerance for any kind of contradiction. This could eventually cause you to try to succeed in destructive manner. If you give in to these tendencies, you will only be more bitterly disappointed.



Sometime during the course of your life, if you could manage to be a little more friendly to other people and be supportive without expecting something in return, you will find that this will make it easier for you to reach your own goals."
323;RADIX_0000000001851650;Your Mars in Opposition with Your Uranus;"You are inclined to sudden emotional outbursts or look for fights. These mood swings do not exactly encourage others to reward you with their confidence. Often you react with aggression and express your distaste for any kind of routine or discipline.



The problem with this opposition is that you probably will have difficulties developing good judgment. Because of your struggle for independence, it is not easy for the people around you to deal with you in a laid back and easy way. Nothing runs against your will and you may drive your boss crazy with your reluctance to take advice and by insisting on doing things your way under any circumstances. Only painful experiences will be able to convince you to get a grip on your life and change your attitude.



Your life may change suddenly and decisively. Possibly you moved in your early childhood, which may explain your restlessness. Watch out that you are not too unstable and drive people around you nuts."
324;RADIX_0000000002113794;Your Mars in Opposition with Your Neptune;"This aspect implies some restrictions on your actions because of the contradictory qualities of Mars and Neptune. This may result in an inability to use reason to keep your behavior under control with any efficiency. Sometimes you may lose sight of the general picture and give the impression that you are disorganized.



There may be a lot of misunderstanding between you and other people. You should be more open and honest in your dealings with people instead of scaring them off with an undercurrent of your driving nature; this is often difficult for anyone else to understand. Once you become aware of the aggressive Martian qualities that probably crop up uncontrollably and make your life difficult, your behavior will be more understandable.



An unusual need for love and tenderness can be traced back to the suppressed wishes of your childhood and sometimes collide with life's daily responsibilities. The resulting frustration should under no circumstances be answered by consuming intoxicating substances; this will put you completely out of it. In extreme cases, the discord within you may manifest itself as an illness.



The greatest problem with this aspect is the difficulties acquiring even a somewhat realistic outlook on life. This is caused by the clouded and unfocused energies of the planet Neptune. Thoughtless action could be the result, which is why you should always take time to consider about what your doing before you take action."
325;RADIX_0000000002375938;Your Mars in Opposition with Your Pluto;"Generally, it can be said that this aspect creates discord between your individual drive and aggression, which are associated with the planet Mars, and your will, symbolized by Pluto. You can be very defiant when you are forced to feel the consequences of your own behavior. Sometimes you are not able to keep your reactions in line out of an inability to understand how someone can react aggressively to you, even when everyone else agrees that you pushed things too far.



Sexual passions can be very intense, because you get involved in deep relationships that are turbulent. Watch out that you do not misuse your own magnetism to exploit people, or one day you could become a victim of this yourself. Learn to control your lust for power over others.



It is important for you to consider the pros and cons carefully in everything you undertake, whereby you should not ignore compromise as an option. Take as much time as you need to think about what you want to achieve and be careful to avoid invading other people's space."
326;RADIX_0000000008405250;Your Mars in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;"Having been given enough energy, you often do not know how to use it. Others perceive you as being off-balance and lacking orientation. It could be that you have not yet found the right cause. A strong drive to reflect on the past sometimes prevents you from recognizing opportunities for the future. Often you feel burnt out, without having done anything. Activate your energy and channel it into paths that will allow you to take on the challenges of life.



Negative experiences have left you feeling sexually frustrated and incapable of letting anyone get too close to you. It would probably help you to experience your body and improve your self-awareness by participating in sports."
327;RADIX_0000000009191682;Your Mars in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"Being loaded with energy and always trying to leave an impression, you may go so far as to meddle in other people's affairs. This will not always be to your advantage.



It is important for you to act with caution and to avoid rushing into things. A little patience at the right time and place can have a tremendous advantage on your energetic potential. It will not get you anywhere if people decide to avoid you because of your hot-headedness. Even if you find it difficult you should get used to accepting compromises; people will thank you for it."
328;RADIX_0000000009453826;Your Mars in Opposition with Your MC;"The relationship to your parents may not have been the best. An unhappy childhood may be the root of the problems you are experiencing today at work. Sometimes it would be better for you to stay cool instead of giving your emotions free run. Hitting your head on the wall will only serve to drive people away, and that is not what you want.



Maybe you were closer to one parent and this worked against your home environment or you tried to play your parents against each other. This will not get you anywhere in the long run. Consider the advantages to playing with an open hand and earning people's trust and respect."
329;RADIX_0000000001343746;Your Mars in Square with Your Jupiter;"It is very important for you to be careful not to invest your surplus of energy in the wrong causes. Do not waste energy on useless projects. It is especially important for you to continue projects that you have started and not jump from one activity to the next, whenever you get bored. Maybe your self-image is so poor that you do not feel adequate to fulfill the responsibilities of society and are unable to work determined and persistently enough. Let time teach you how to acquire a feeling of achievement.



Do not waste the money other people entrust you with and stay away from political extremists. A tendency for excessive and uncontrollable behavior as well as an addiction to spending money crops up in the signs and houses where Mars and Jupiter appear in your chart. It is also possible that you find yourself in a permanent state of restlessness because you are constantly in search of activity and excitement. Relaxation may be a foreign word to you."
330;RADIX_0000000001605890;Your Mars in Square with Your Saturn;"This aspect may denote a reserved character that could lead to disappointments. But do not let them get you down or you will develop an extremely depressing outlook on life.



In dealing with others, your efforts may not bring about the result you hoped for, especially in relationships to members of the opposite sex. Professionally, you will have a hard time orienting yourself toward a specific goal. The planet Saturn can have an inhibiting effect on your activities; still, you should eventually become capable of structuring your life. It is important to make an extra effort to finish all the activities you started, even if you have no desire to force yourself into it. In dealing with your boss, you should not let yourself be provoked to outbursts, devote your efforts to learning to accept day-to-day responsibilities."
331;RADIX_0000000001868034;Your Mars in Square with Your Uranus;"Keep an eye on the needs of others even if you suddenly feel inclined to get involved in activities which include an element of danger and then rush into them more passionately than is actually necessary. In the areas of your life which are represented by the houses in your chart where Uranus and Mars are found, it may come to tense and varied experiences whereby you are even willing to take great risks.



Early on in life you should make a habit of reflecting and staying calm. If you are not able to keep your temperament in check and start rushing into action, it could lead to an accident. This is also the case if you work with machines and electrical appliances. In your search for excitement you could be in danger of mistaking Route 66 for the racetrack in Indianapolis.



Sometimes you are impulsive. Your explosive reactions can hurt people who are not always understanding of your eccentric outbreaks. If you should decide to become more patient during the course of your life and work more with other people than against them, you would only profit from it."
332;RADIX_0000000002130178;Your Mars in Square with Your Neptune;"This aspect may cause you to sense strange emotional needs that rise from your subconscious. Possibly your actions are determined by subconscious patterns of behavior, which are not in accord with your current situation. This square can have varying effects according to whether it suppresses or formulates your needs. If, sometime during the course of your life, you have felt inclined to suppress your true nature, it could cause discord within your body, which could manifest itself in an illness. Others may get the impression that your actions are not structured or oriented toward a goal because you let yourself be guided by subtle motives.



If you want to take on the challenges of this aspect, you will have to learn to differentiate your dreams from reality. Otherwise, you run the risk of earning a reputation for being flaky. A more serious study of Astrology may advance your development. This will help you to recognize the context of the various aspects of your life."
333;RADIX_0000000002392322;Your Mars in Square with Your Pluto;"Trying to live an extreme life, you will have to watch out that you do not turn to violence as a means of realizing your ambitions. Tolerance of others and more careful planning in your activities would enable you to live contentedly. Sometimes you act out of an extremist tendency and put other people off with your ""all or nothing"" attitude. You should take a closer look at the motives behind this attitude. This may all come out of an egotistical need for revenge, because you are sometimes inclined to crazy, unfounded behavior.



Because your will is well developed, you should avoid losing your orientation and appearing insulted by those around you if you do not get your way. You have to learn to keep your temperament within limits or you will have more problems than you will be able to deal with. As soon as you understand this, you will realize your plans with patience, stamina and courage."
334;RADIX_0000000008421634;Your Mars in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;"This aspect can express itself in a variety of ways. It will be difficult for you to accurately assess your energy. Also, the motivation you need to master your life may not always be available. Maybe you have trouble asserting yourself or are inclined to neglecting your own needs. The painful experiences you have made, after letting yourself be used as a scapegoat too often, leave you feeling inhibited. This can be counteracted by finding an area of interest that fascinates you and which leads to a feeling of accomplishment.



Possibly you feel compelled to put your energy to a good use, but do not know what to do. Sometimes you behave inconsiderately or are even brutal and refuse to cooperate with others. After treating sexual encounters as sporting events you wonder why your relationships do not last. Someday you are going to have to accept that your behavior is not making you happy, but is keeping you from your goals."
335;RADIX_0000000009208066;Your Mars in Square with Your Ascendant;"Being loaded with energy and always trying to leave an impression, you may go so far as to meddle in other people's affairs. This will not always be to your advantage.



It is important for you to act with caution and to avoid rushing into things. A little patience at the right time and place can have a tremendous advantage on your energetic potential.

336;RADIX_0000000009470210;Your Mars in Square with Your MC;The relationship to your parents may not have been the best. An unhappy childhood may be the root of the problems you are experiencing today at work. Sometimes it would be better for you to stay cool instead of giving your emotions free run. Hitting your head on the wall will only serve to drive people away, and that is not what you want.
337;RADIX_0000000001360130;Your Mars in Trine with Your Jupiter;"The ability to take on useful activities with strength and enthusiasm wins you the respect of those around you. Jupiter represents the philosophical and humanitarian components of human life while Mars symbolizes the form in which these qualities are expressed. Sometimes you come to the aid of people in need of support while others do nothing but express their concern.



The projects that you think up and put into practice make use of your energy and optimism. No effort is too great when it comes to improving your general education. According to karmic Astrology, you may have earned ""Good Karma"" in your last life and are now capable of transforming negative circumstances into positive.



Probably you are active in sports and sense an urge to travel and have adventures. Traveling will introduce you to new cultures and religions. Young people feel drawn to you and you may look for a profession working with youth."
338;RADIX_0000000001622274;Your Mars in Trine with Your Saturn;"The most difficult problems interest you the most, because you are in a position to act constructively. At the same time, nothing is worse for you than to waste energy which could otherwise be put to good use. This is why you constantly work towards bringing all your endeavors to a successful close. Often you are envied for your tremendous willpower.



Your meticulousness may eventually lead you to take up a profession in a technological field. Just as your determination will enable you to earn recognition and help you rise to a higher position. This is also due to your patience, practical skills and drive as well as he ability to keep things under control in stress situations because you are strong enough to endure hardships."

You are in a position to recognize out-dated structures and replace them with new and more productive means. When it comes to increasing the efficiency of procedures at your job, you will be the first one to make suggestions. In satisfying your professional determination, you use unconventional methods and always have new ideas. These qualities should make you successful.



An open and enthusiastic character lets you go about every day life full of energy. Also, esoteric fields may interest you and teach you things that have a practical application.

It would be healthful for you to compensate by taking relaxed walks in nature."
340;RADIX_0000000002146562;Your Mars in Trine with Your Neptune;"Probably you have supernatural powers, which could be expressed in healing powers or in an esoteric field of study.

You are extremely sensitive to nonverbal communication.



When action is called for, you are decisive and can keep your adversary in check using stamina and refined perception.

If you should ever feel like letting your talent for dancing come to light, go ahead and give in to the feeling, you will feel healthier for it."
341;RADIX_0000000002408706;Your Mars in Trine with Your Pluto;"With your willpower, you are able to tap into inexhaustible energy sources that enable you to do a lot for others. Understanding and contact to reality play an important role whenever you do anything, because these qualities let you encounter everyone in a loving and respectful manner, which also earns you recognition.



If you develop an interest in esoteric fields, you could probably use tremendous amounts of energy for improving your surroundings, whereby you will not hesitate to fight for your own interests. Your friends are sometime surprised by your ability to mobilize your last reserves in order to master a difficult situation or to defend values that are important to you. With your constant readiness to resist, it should be easy."
342;RADIX_0000000008438018;Your Mars in Trine with Your Northern Moon Node;Having been given enough energy, you are able to ration it out. Being sure of yourself, you greet life with a healthy drive for independence.

People are attracted by your charm because your drive and energy keep you involved in useful activities with realistic goals. This aspect is essentially pleasant and will serve you well in the course of your life.
343;RADIX_0000000009224450;Your Mars in Trine with Your Ascendant;"As a human bundle of energy you are always working toward goals with persistence and determination.

You are interested in maintaining a harmonious flow of energy, if you only knew more exactly how to go about it.

346;RADIX_0000000001638658;Your Mars in Sextile with Your Saturn;"An abundance of energy and perseverance may draw you to manual labor. You may practice a craft where your technical skills are especially useful.



The planet Saturn keeps Mars' aggressive potential under control while Mars overcomes Saturn's fear and motivates courage.

Being courageous and full of enthusiasm, you know how to tap into universal energy sources and make use of them to improve the lives of many people.



Make use of the opportunity to understand the theme of the house where Pluto is found at a higher intellectual level. Pluto may have enough influence to expand your consciousness.

353;RADIX_0000000000000262;Your Mars in the First House;"When Mars is in the first house, it cannot be very far from the ascendant. This may enrage the planet or make it furious.



You are going to have to learn to deal with aggressiveness or it may prove harmful to your health. You should avoid taking your aggressions out on yourself and acting aggressively towards others. You can learn controlling yourself by doing physical labor or through sports. Practicing self-defense, which is a method of relaxation, could be of help.



You appear honest, intuitive and open. It is no problem for you to pursue your goals intensely and to take your interests very seriously. Your nature will not allow you to be afraid of making your own experiences and to confront life. You should not wait around for something to happen but take the initiative yourself.



You harbor the potential to achieve your ambitions, which makes it difficult to explain why you ask for help and call upon the resources of other people. Usually you take responsibility for your life and do not hesitate to go your own way."

Take care not to react too spontaneously and tense up because it will negatively effect the results you are working for.



Probably you are addicted to material consumption and want immediate gratification. Your entire personality might be obsessively possessive. When you are forced into venting your aggression, do not take it out on defenseless objects, which will only increase your frustration.



You invest all your energies in a courageous endeavor to keep your values. However, watch that you do not put other people under too much pressure. If money and material possessions symbolize power to you, the consequence may be an attempt to use your successful acquisitions as an expression of your individuality and life energy, whereby you also seek approval by displaying your determination to achieve what you set out to do."
355;RADIX_0000000000033030;Your Mars in the Third House;"You get a great feeling from presenting your views and opinions with passion or by getting into discussions. This is your way of letting off steam. This may also be why you have trouble talking about your feelings or explaining what is happening to you. It may be that you only hint at what is troubling you or rely on subtle body language to convey your message. If you are interested in developing your character and keeping your circle of friends, you should take a closer look at the concept of ""tact"".



Basically, with your mental alertness and wit you should have no problem learning to communicate. No matter what comes, you always know a good response. Logic, which can be useful when used correctly, could become an ax. Do not ignore its destructive powers.



You choose to confront life's interesting topics and want to discuss or at least write about everything you perceive. This helps you to let off steam.



If you develop an inclination for a nervous or hectic style, practice your self-discipline and work out regularly."
356;RADIX_0000000000049414;Your Mars in the Fourth House;"Mars in the fourth house can be an indication for hidden aggressions that you should bring out and try to understand. You may burst into an outrage, shocking not only those around you but even yourself. Once you are able to analyze these outbreaks, you should be able to manage to accept your potential for aggression as one aspect of your nature and find a positive expression for it. This will provide you with an energy boost for other things.



You feel no need for public spectacles. Probably you sense vitality in your home and personal life. On the other side you may be inclined to take things out on your family, whenever something is not to your liking. If you think you need to tear about at home, then use your energy positively, such as for cleaning.



You probably found your mother was dominant or testy. Possibly you fought a lot with her in the process of finding yourself. These problems were later solved when you moved out or became more independent."
357;RADIX_0000000000065798;Your Mars in the Fifth House;"The fifth house is a place to bring out playful tendencies. With Mars in this house it should be clear who is dominating these games. When you are overtrumped, your ambitious nature challenges you to consider ways to improve yourself. For you it is about winning and losing, not about fairness.



You bring the same energy levels into romance and creative activities. You are highly motivated in your endeavors, whereby a little drama is usually included in the package. Your high energy and talent for motivating others are your most positive attributes. In the arts, your creative techniques may not be the most refined, the works you have produced until now have been very important to you.



You love sports and match your strength and courage against your opponent. You also devote your energies to making love. You are capable of passion that is unequaled. Usually you do not have a long span of attention when it comes to romantic relationships. A few unforgettable hours is sometimes more important than a long term relationship. This is why you have shied away from the responsibilities of a family in the past years. If you should ever overcome your reservations, you could probably get into roughhousing with the kids in the yard."
358;RADIX_0000000000082182;Your Mars in the Sixth House;"In the sixth house you try to take care of daily responsibilities necessary for living. You invest all your energy in doing your work with care. Your perfectionism makes you take on a lot of responsibility and to be pleased when everything goes well. In a complicated job you see only the challenge. You know how important a well-functioning body is, which is why you are concerned with your health. Some people think you exaggerate in that respect.



You are sure you know how things are supposed to be done, which can be difficult when you are expected to cooperate with others. It is not simple for you to explain your standpoint to your colleagues. It would be better for you to go into business for yourself. Then the only one you would have to deal with is your own reflection. If you were not so biased it would be worthwhile to find out about the advantages of a cooperative enterprise. If you take a few basic principles to heart, you would be a highly valued employee, who is also known for helping out colleagues.



Your motto can be reduced simply to ""speed"". It would do you good to replace it with ""toil in tempo"". You are in danger of overloading yourself and ruining your health. Maybe you should learn some relaxation and meditation techniques: It would bring some peace and quiet into your life."
359;RADIX_0000000000098566;Your Mars in the Seventh House;"With the planet Mars in the seventh house you develop your personality through an influx of energy from personal relationships. Keep your temperament in check or you will scare people off who you only just met.



You could feel drawn to someone who takes over decision making for you. You think that a partnership will make you more independent and help you find yourself. The initial erotic attraction may wear off, and if you do not watch out you find yourself playing power games, which only serve to bring everybody down. Possibly you will not be able to tolerate the domination of someone else and try to regain the control which you willingly gave away.



Mars in the seventh house is not only associated with conflict-laden relationships. It can also lead to a passionate and stimulating partnership, in which you help each other develop without limiting each other's freedom. If you manage to control your inclination to let your aggression out on the people you love most, you will reach a state of relative harmony. The approval you need from others will not be long coming."
360;RADIX_0000000000114950;Your Mars in the Eighth House;"You have high energy, which is especially noticeable in your way of dealing with others. You do not hesitate to put everything you have into relationships because they simultaneously offer you an opportunity to tank up on energy. The spiritual exchange of energies is your fountain of life.



This behavior also brings dangers with it. If you live out your negative side, you could catch yourself unscrupulously manipulating people in your surroundings and indoctrinating them to serve your ambitions. It is only a question of time until your usefulness has run out and you find yourself isolated. Also, you could divert your arrogance into risky financial ventures only to be left in the end with nothing to live on. If Mars has challenging aspects, your domineering nature could result in difficulties in relationships and social ties.



Sex is an important topic for you. You are a temperamental lover, but you should guard yourself against bringing your aggression into the bedroom by using sex as a means of power or you will find yourself trapped by your own lack of restraint."
361;RADIX_0000000000131334;Your Mars in the Ninth House;"The ninth house represents the area of ethics, philosophy, education and travel to distant lands. You invest all your energy in these areas. You have firm ethics and defend them vigorously. At worst, you tend toward religious fanaticism or completely reject contrary opinions. You should exercise tolerance and approach the search for truth more relaxed. Do not forget that everyone has a claim to their own truth, as long as it is not misused as a legitimization for hurting people.



You love to travel and sometimes decide to change your destination spontaneously. Foreign people exercise a great erotic attraction on you. You may find yourself in a relationship with a foreign person. Professionally, you may be a writer, work in publishing or in education. You will always devote some of your energies to learning and probably will not have any negative experiences because your vitality comes from your immense curiosity."
362;RADIX_0000000000147718;Your Mars in the Tenth House;"With Mars in the tenth house, you will never be satisfied with a low position. You strive to advance, investing all your energy and if it cannot be avoided, your aggressiveness. You want your achievements to be recognized and respected. With your stamina, you could reach unfathomable heights. You should be able to work your way from dishwasher to millionaire. Pay attention that your endeavors do not take on an inconsiderate form and bring about situations in which you feel justified in doing anything that will get you where you want to go.



If Mars in the tenth house has challenging aspects, you probably have had a difficult childhood. Possibly you experienced your father as authoritarian and aggressive and were afraid of him. It was not easy for you to cut yourself free from his influence and develop your own ideas. Make sure that your achievements are not actually supposed to prove something to your father. That could strain your relations to your bosses and also serve as motivation for you to achieve a position where you will not have to take anything from anybody. In any case, it would do you good to relax and back away from the stress at work."
363;RADIX_0000000000164102;Your Mars in the Eleventh House;"Mars in the eleventh house represents activities in organizations and with friends. You love it when you can organize an event and put all your energy into doing it right. But do not forget the interests of the community. A pledge to cooperate does not remove all the problems involved in giving in and taking part in discussions about other peoples' ideas and concepts. You may make decisions alone that are meant to be binding for everyone. Reexamine your commitment to cooperation in concrete cases.



If Mars receives challenging aspects you may want to draw strength from cooperation and hide behind an organization. Maybe your fear of making your own way will leave you vulnerable to anyone offering to lead. Break away from the crowd, stand up and develop your individuality.

You will then be faced with the challenge of finding a compromise."
364;RADIX_0000000000180486;Your Mars in the Twelfth House;"It may be difficult for you to show your aggression openly, which is why you suppress your anger until the point where it suddenly explodes. In the intervals between, you feel nervous and are not sure why. It is important for you to learn to deal with aggression constructively and to let other people know immediately if something is bothering you. It would also be good to back up a step and take a look at what upsets and frustrates you. If you do not succeed you may develop a tendency for self-destructive behavior, which certainly is not in your interest.



You should generate more energy and put it into living. When something does not suit you, be the first to initiate a change. Take the responsibility for your life and stop wasting your time complaining about everything and falling into lethargy. Your dreams may show you a way out of the mess. If you could create a sense of achievement, which would allow you to recognize your strengths, you would find it inspiring.



Once you have found your strengths, you will be capable of fighting for the rights of others and offering help completely selflessly."

With Jupiter in Scorpio you will not necessarily have any trouble learning more about the world around you. It should be easier for you to share this essential knowledge with others than for other people, once you manage to come out of your hiding place.

Continuing education is very important to you because you are convinced that the only way to stay competitive is to keep yourself one step ahead of everyone else. These efforts profit from your remarkable memory because you can keep up on the latest developments."

Generosity and benevolence make you welcome everywhere you go. Your sense of responsibility will eventually cause you to be admired and will lead to a lofty public position.

385;RADIX_0000000001589570;Your Jupiter in Opposition with Your Saturn;"Frequently you will try to complain about your fate. There is hardly an aspect of life that is not difficult for you. Although you want to be recognized, others insist on standing back and watching how well you cope with your overload of obligations. Sometimes you are inclined to take on responsibility that you do not really think you can handle. Learn to make better use of your time, this will prevent many professional and financial problems.

This would frequently involve investing money that other people have placed in your trust. Unforeseen problems could result in everyone taking part losing their investment. You should proceed with caution and try to foresee potential dangers. Take measures to prevent abuse of your trusting and confiding nature.



Although you are capable of generosity and acts of idealism, you could lose your realistic sense of judgment and let your imagination get so carried away that your grip on reality is endangered. A lot of people have problems with you because they are put off by your inclination to eccentric behavior. Just as they are aware that you often promise more than you are capable of delivering, which does not exactly increase your popularity.



Out of determined passion, you battle against the existing ethical and educational concepts perpetrated by society. Even when you are certain that you are at fault, you defiantly defend your outlook on life. You may have sudden urges to travel to experience unplanned adventures."
387;RADIX_0000000002113858;Your Jupiter in Opposition with Your Neptune;"People are often left with the impression that you are somewhat absent-minded, which can be so extreme that you seem to them to be insincere. It would be a good idea to avoid making promises that you are not sure you can keep. If it goes too far you will gain a reputation for being irresponsible and incompetent. Specifically your problem is a general inability to recognize life's responsibilities and to adequately fulfill them. An illusive view of life only serves to further distort your perception of reality. Outwardly you try to project a spiritual image, whereas you are not capable of becoming objective enough to discriminate within yourself. Sometimes you express feelings of deep sentimentality, but it can really get on everyone's nerves.



Take special care not to follow self-proclaimed spiritual leaders. Demanding worship and reverence cannot be in conjunction with the will of God. For this reason you should guard against projecting aspects of your own egocentrism onto others. The practical experience which life brings to you will make noticeable improvements in your behavior."

If you carry your need to be recognized too far, you will have problems that will make harmonious relationships nearly impossible.



Constant boasting and your inability to appear humble even once are responsible for your lack of popularity. You should pay attention that you do not force yourself into isolation, where no one is really happy."
389;RADIX_0000000008405314;Your Jupiter in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;"If you try, you can fight against the old-fashioned morality and conform to the times. Experience should have taught you that the world has changed and the people with it, to the extent that your outdated ideas would not get you anywhere. Maybe you were raised conservatively and have trouble not taking concepts like tradition and responsibility so seriously. If your thoughts do not conform willingly, it may take a few turbulent events to change them. Do not stand in your own way; use the opportunities that arise. It is important that you realize that you cannot determine everything and that life is an adventure. Approach your work with optimism and joy. Do not be too quick to condemn people with different ideas, but listen to them first."

You will often complain about your bad luck, but should actually take a closer look at yourself and the way you are running things, because your sense of judgment leaves much to be desired. Nobody except you is surprised when your financial tightrope act is doomed to failure. It may be that you want to be known for your willingness to accept responsibility without first making sure that you are able to handle it. It would be better for you to cut back on your expectations, loosen up, become more flexible and subdue your unbridled determination. You will find that your life is not so monotone and frustrating and you will also get a grip on your bouts of depression.



If the planet Jupiter dominates your chart and Saturn is somewhat weaker you may lack self-discipline. If the opposite is true, you should be capable of working hard and persevering, although you may have trouble convincing others to cooperate with you.

393;RADIX_0000000001868098;Your Jupiter in Square with Your Uranus;"Watch out that you do not immediately give in to every impulse, often your attention will not focus on the aspects that have the most practical use for you. Being subject to extreme mood-swings, you are capable of devoting your entire energy to something of which you can no longer understand the importance the next day. This can lead to a constant stream of new interests, which could cause you to completely lose sight of your life's goals.



If you are inclined to speculation, you should take into account that if you do not get it together to think before you act, you run the risk of suffering grievous financial losses. It is extremely important for you to take a close look at the pros and cons before you begin a project and put your investments at risk.



Maybe your restlessness will manifest itself in a desire to go on excursions, to take on challenges or to suddenly break out and see some of the world. You should take special care to avoid exotic sects and other organizations that could prove to be dangerous for you. On the other hand, you could recognize which characteristics of the foreign cultures you encounter could be useful for your life."
394;RADIX_0000000002130242;Your Jupiter in Square with Your Neptune;"Try to keep your enthusiasm under control, it could be that you subscribe strange spiritual ideals, which do not conform to reality by any stretch of the imagination. It is possible that you will lose contact with reality while your life falls into complete chaos. It is essential for you to find your identity sometime during the course of your life and to strengthen your ties to reality.



Sometimes you are overtaken by an urge to travel and to have unusual experiences in distant exotic lands. A certain restlessness will always accompany you, so that you will hardly be able to live your whole life in one place or to stay in the same region. Maybe you will feel at home in another country, but you should make sure that you are not trying to run away from yourself.



A love of comfort and luxury hinders your development. If you do not watch out you may start living beyond your means and make promises to others that you are not able to keep. Avoid extreme and extended culinary consumption. It is unpleasant to go around overweight by 50 pounds."
395;RADIX_0000000002392386;Your Jupiter in Square with Your Pluto;"Be careful not to push your orthodox views of the world onto others. If you have a tendency to lecture others, this will eventually provoke personal conflicts. Avoid letting yourself get too arrogant and insolent, this sort of behavior is not conducive to creating a pleasant environment. Probably you will always try to fight against the existing authorities because you want to bring a new world order into being, which may turn out to be no better than the old one.



The recognition of the existing social norms is very difficult for you because you see yours as the only acceptable standard of behavior.

Most probably, you will not ever conform without either being forced into it or receiving substantial personal benefits in the deal. As long as you take yourself so seriously, you will never really be happy."
396;RADIX_0000000008421698;Your Jupiter in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;"Sometimes you fail to recognize opportunities or do not understand when you should take the initiative to do something. As you evade looking for the purpose behind unpleasant experiences, your general dissatisfaction with life does not let itself be ignored. All that is necessary is for you to change directions and recognize the signs of the times. Draw consequences out of your experiences and change your attitude or your philosophy of life.



Sometimes you force yourself to continue on with things that you know are not going to work out. There are times when you are convinced of things that are not confirmed by reality, which is why you should open up and try to meet people. Also more tolerance would be beneficial in your efforts to reach your goals."
397;RADIX_0000000009208130;Your Jupiter in Square with Your Ascendant;"The planet Jupiter square to the Ascendant could manifest itself in a certain lack of restraint and put you in a position to realize your goals with optimism and a good portion of enthusiasm although you may be lacking the necessary discipline. For this reason, you should try not to promise too much because your projects sometimes get too large to be realized.



It may help to work together with others that will bring out your individual talents and encourage you to cooperate and accept compromises.



Because the Ascendant is related to appearance and the planet Jupiter represents the principle of expansion, you should try to avoid excessive culinary gratification; otherwise you may be forced to set off in search of an effective diet. If you should ever get caught up in travel fever, do not hesitate to give in to it. Traveling the world has always been a way to expand one's horizons."
398;RADIX_0000000009470274;Your Jupiter in Square with Your MC;"Watch out that you do not take on too much at work and make a pretense of projects that you will never be able to realize. Often you tell others about your latest professional ideas, which have not the slightest chance of being realized. A little humility coupled with some common sense would do you good at times.



Possibly as a child you felt like you were just one face in the crowd, and are trying to compensate for that now. Avoid exaggerations, because Jupiter's energies can only be expressed positively when they are used for everybody's benefit. If you try to use them to further your interests, do not be surprised if you run into great difficulties."
399;RADIX_0000000001622338;Your Jupiter in Trine with Your Saturn;"People appreciate you for your responsible character, which implies that you also have a lot of common sense. This enables you to organize your business and economical affairs efficiently. Others profit from your life experience that helps them to see beyond their immediate surroundings. An ability to coordinate is helpful during the most difficult tasks.



Because you prefer working in an area with plenty of social contacts, you would probably not be averse to a career in politics. With your good reputation, you could also be quite successful. A serious and contemplative nature lets you lead a stable life. Those around you may profit from your good works, but you will never let anyone else decide whom you should help."
400;RADIX_0000000001884482;Your Jupiter in Trine with Your Uranus;"With this trine, you must be capable of creative and inspirational works. You are interested in the esoteric world and in parapsychology. According to Karmic Astrology, the generosity in your past life will ensure that you are met with fortune when you most need it. With your intuitive feeling and your spiritual abilities, you can recognize and make use of opportunities which others have overlooked.



Hardly anything is more important than your autonomy. This is why you do your best to prevent anyone or anything from restricting your freedom. You try to keep your life full of diverse activities which is why you frequently travel to exotic or less exotic destinations where you have the opportunity to add to your unusual experiences."
401;RADIX_0000000002146626;Your Jupiter in Trine with Your Neptune;"A spiritual nature opens your mind for esoteric ideas. But a lack of discipline through logic may result in your emotions taking up too much space. A more conscientious approach to life should help you to keep your emotional nature within the limits of reason.



Due to your deep understanding for other people's problems you are very generous and benevolent towards others. You especially take care of people who identify with your own outlook on life. Because you understand life within a greater context, you experience moments of intense clarity.



Being able to influence your surroundings positively is your idea of fulfillment. If you make more of an effort, you will also succeed. A limitless imagination together with your benevolence will allow you to lose yourself in creativity, which is more your style than participating in colorless, sober activities. Others can easily get caught up in your enthusiasm and joy."
402;RADIX_0000000002408770;Your Jupiter in Trine with Your Pluto;"A strong willpower sometimes makes you seem capable of bringing the stars down from the sky. With your ability to recover quickly from strenuous exertions, you will be able to accomplish a lot in your life.

403;RADIX_0000000008438082;Your Jupiter in Trine with Your Northern Moon Node;This pleasant aspect lets you look toward the future optimistically, recognizing the signs of the times. No matter what you take on, it seems to always work out to your satisfaction and allow you to enjoy a higher standard of living. Being open for everything new, you greet people wholeheartedly. Out of interest in the fundamental questions of life, you sometimes begin to philosophize or read more sophisticated books. Study of exotic cultures and the world views of foreign peoples expand your horizon. If you are able to resist your inclination to seek comfort and maintain your level of activity, you will achieve your life's ambition.
404;RADIX_0000000009224514;Your Jupiter in Trine with Your Ascendant;"The planet Jupiter forming a trine to your Ascendant promises you a great deal and puts you in a position to take on your surroundings with optimism and a generous portion of enthusiasm. In your generosity, you are always ready to offer your support to others. This earns you a lot of trust and makes a lasting impression on people. Relations to the opposite sex will also expand your horizons.



All in all, it is definitely a positive aspect to have in a birth chart; still, you should be careful not to take on too much. Occasional relaxation would certainly do you good.



If you should ever get caught up in travel fever, do not hesitate to give in to it. Traveling the world has always been an educational experience."
405;RADIX_0000000009486658;Your Jupiter in Trine with Your MC;"Because you are honest and respectable, you will become important and respected during the course of your life. Generosity and benevolence make you welcome everywhere you go. Your sense of responsibility will eventually cause you to be admired and will lead to a lofty public position. 



Both your private affairs and your household are important to you and you were treated fairly and lovingly in your childhood. This has put you in a position to transfer these qualities to your family. If you have children of your own they will bring you a lot of joy and will support you in your life's endeavors."
406;RADIX_0000000001638722;Your Jupiter in Sextile with Your Saturn;"This sextile keeps the concept of expansion and stability in balance. In your professional endeavors, you will exercise caution and enthusiasm at the appropriate times to ensure the success of your plans. The effective fulfillment of your responsibilities earns you the respect of those around you, because you deal sincerely with everyone.



Being interested in life's philosophical and ethical questions, you are able to actively support the people neglected by fate in an intelligent manner, but only up to the point where they are capable of helping themselves. You are no Samaritan; your motto is ""helping people help themselves"".



An interest in politics has led you to work with political initiatives or to join a party. The ability to stay focused on your goal enables you to develop a perspective in which your worldview includes a vision of a better future."
407;RADIX_0000000001900866;Your Jupiter in Sextile with Your Uranus;"It is possible for you to adapt to the constantly changing social circumstances and to use them productively. You show your interest for new publications of philosophy, including esoteric fields. Possibly you have telepathic abilities. Should you develop a special interest in Astrology, your talents will not be a disadvantage, especially if you are able to intuitively identify connections.



Optimism and a peaceful way of dealing with people win you a lot of friends and also makes you popular. Your friends like to visit you at home; the originality of your parties is the topic of conversation for days afterwards. Your confidence comes from your drive, which lets you realize your plans and fulfill your wishes.



Being fascinated by new technologies, you have probably started working with computers. Although this is the technology that is developing at the fastest rate, you are determined to keep up."
408;RADIX_0000000002163010;Your Jupiter in Sextile with Your Neptune;"People have a definite tendency to like you because of your enthusiasm; still, you may have a bit of a deficit in practical skills. If you are not able to get by in life with your two left hands, then you should be able to use your creativity to establish a satisfactory livelihood.



Art and philosophy are your primary interests, whereby your emotional involvement is sometimes very intense. For less fortunate people you have no trouble feeling sympathetic, but to put your feelings into action you need original ideas, and even more so, a lot of self-discipline. With your sentimentality and your inclination to take the easy way, this will probably be difficult for you. Remember that your guardian angel will take care of you, especially in a crisis. Somehow you will be supported when you need it, whether you have earned it or not."
409;RADIX_0000000002425154;Your Jupiter in Sextile with Your Pluto;"Philosophical studies serve to renew your intellectual capacities in pursuit of high idealistic goals and give you the power to work toward improving the quality of life for everyone. Spiritual practice may enable you to come into contact with universal energy sources and make your own creative expression possible. It would be helpful to make sure that you are acting in everyone's best interest.



When choosing a partner, you prefer someone who shares your involvement in social and charitable work. Working together, you can relieve a multitude of people of part of their burden.



With enough ideas and inexhaustible energy you are able to proceed in your endeavors and before you can turn around, others have gotten caught up in your enthusiasm and are motivated to help you get the stars down from the sky. The planet Pluto gives Jupiter's beneficial qualities a chance to express themselves and influence the way things are going."

413;RADIX_0000000000000326;Your Jupiter in the First House;"With Jupiter in the first house you enjoy delving into the questions of philosophy. You approach life with optimism anticipating what will happen. This can inspire people who see you as a bearer of hope. Keeping up on the latest trends is important to you. Financial success comes from your feel for development.



If Jupiter has challenging aspects, you can become dogmatic and therefore unable to appreciate the pleasant side of life. You try to force your convictions on others and your intolerance causes you to look down on other belief systems. Do not let your arrogance drive you into isolation and learn to accept the human shortcomings in others.



In general, you should not have any problems getting along with your friends because you seem to generate something which is best described by the word benevolence. You see life as an adventure or as a long journey. Actually, you can spend more time on foreign continents than at home. If you manage to avoid the risk of overestimating yourself, you could be lucky and look back on a very fulfilling life."
414;RADIX_0000000000016710;Your Jupiter in the Second House;"Probably you have fun acquiring and keeping things, this may make your house seem like it is about to burst its seams. Your drive and energy steadily contributes to your wealth, which makes you happy because your sense of security is very important and is dependent on cash flow. Still, you usually manage to use your resources for sensible things and also share with others. 



You should take care not to turn into a materialist thinker, except in numbers. Maybe you will believe in a connection between religious belief and economic success like the Calvinists, such that the level of your bank account measures how you please God. You like to make your own rules and should avoid letting that harm other people.



In finances, you should actually possess a substantial nest egg and probably simply luck out regularly. You could also suffer from compulsive wastefulness and throw everything you have earned out the window. You can almost always rely on your ability, even in such situations, to come up with an appropriate idea.



Professionally, you could work in the travel industry, in law or in commerce."
415;RADIX_0000000000033094;Your Jupiter in the Third House;"You want to expand your horizons through constant exchanges with a lot of different people. You are always up for a conversation and find it easy to meet people and listen to other opinions. You appreciate the diversity of opinions and let yourself be convinced by good arguments. You recount your experiences without embellishments. The views presented to you in conversations often inspire you to begin new projects. You love both the spoken and the written word and most likely have a well-stocked library. Intellectual progress is important to you, whereby you appreciate the developments in the media that have brought the world closer together and enable constant, unlimited access to information.

You probably have a large circle of friends and keep in touch with your brothers and sisters.



You may be talkative and have a weakness for gossip. You may approach every topic superficially because your various activities wear you out and you want to avoid taking a stand whenever possible."
416;RADIX_0000000000049478;Your Jupiter in the Fourth House;"You will decorate your home stylishly and extravagantly. You would be capable of turning a hut into a small palace. A tasteful environment is important to you, but you should be wary of an inclination to overdo it.



You brought your values along from childhood when your family shaped your intellectual development. Your childhood provided you with a positive outlook on life. You were impressed by your mother and probably still follow her example. She may have first brought you into contact with a foreign culture. Hopefully, your childhood home was not too restricting. If you were not given enough freedom to think and live the way you wanted to, your fear of restrictions may cause you to hesitate to start a family.



Friends are attracted to your house and you are known for your hospitality. You like hosting parties and even let people stay overnight on occasion. This is why you value a lot of space and maybe even have already moved out of the city. If not, your love of nature makes it an interesting alternative for you."
417;RADIX_0000000000065862;Your Jupiter in the Fifth House;"The fifth house is a suitable stage for Jupiter's performance. It can tear around and turn life into one big adventure. It is constantly in search of anything new, which will inspire creativity and expand its horizons. It takes on every challenge and does not let failure bring it down for very long.



You keep yourself active, without taking life seriously. Your playful nature will engage your creativity and imagination to creatively stage countless love affairs. You do not live by the dry, serious and philosophical Jupiter principle, but prefer to give in to all the pleasures which life has to offer. Your art reveals signs of openness and joy, which is why good-humored people show appreciation for your works. Naturally, you are in danger of becoming decadent, but you could deal with dying from a heart attack at 40 for a satisfying life up until then.



At sports, you give everything and you like to compete. You are good with children and are more than prepared for all sorts of childish nonsense that they are likely to think up."
418;RADIX_0000000000082246;Your Jupiter in the Sixth House;"The sixth house is devoted to health and the daily routine. You can find your purpose in life by giving service to humanity or at least in the attempt. Regardless of what you come up with, you always want to find a purpose in what you are doing. When you fine-tune your capacities, you will live a satisfactory and pleasant life.



It is important to you to really take pleasure in your work. You would not take on a job below your capacity. Because Jupiter symbolizes the principle of expansion, you could have a tendency to take on too much or work especially pedantically. If you feel used or wait in vain for recognition of your achievements, the negative energy in your body could manifest itself as illness. Illness may be the only legitimization for you to rest or allow yourself to be cared for. Do not set your standards for yourself too high, but enjoy your free time. You should also learn to recognize the achievements of others. You should give up your arrogant dismissal of other people's reliability along with your belief that only you know how everything should be done. Delegate a few tasks and give yourself a break.



In general, you have a good relationship with your body and have a talent for giving appropriate suggestions and helping people onto their feet."
419;RADIX_0000000000098630;Your Jupiter in the Seventh House;"You are looking for happiness in your relationships and get into the dilemma of having to sacrifice a piece of your precious freedom. However, you are not immune to jealousy, either. You need a partner who accepts you as you are and appreciates your positive side. Your creativity enriches your relationships and you have a large selection of unusual seduction techniques at your disposal. You want to enjoy love without having to take on responsibility. You may be looking for the perfect partner, who will never be in need of your help, and are denying reality. You may refuse to make a move toward a monogamous relationship out of fear that you could be missing something.



In spite of this, Jupiter in the seventh house tells us of personal happiness in relationships. If you find a partner who is independent and gives you freedom, you are capable of a longer relationship. This will certainly not get boring because you will provide the excitement.



Even on the social level, you should be prepared for all kinds of contacts. It should not be difficult for you to get to know people, because you are open and friendly and make a self-confident impression."
420;RADIX_0000000000115014;Your Jupiter in the Eighth House;"Jupiter in the eighth house describes personal expansion through the exchange of resources with others. Jupiter will place a protecting hand over you by making contact to other people's wealth. You may find yourself in a financially profitable partnership, either of a romantic or business nature, or you may come into an inheritance. You can sense financial and political developments and can trust your instinct to invest well.



In your personal relationships, you do not hesitate to place everything you have at everyone's disposal. This is how you find fulfillment and develop. You have an eye for human qualities and can even transform negative qualities into positive.



Getting a grip on your sexual needs could pose a problem for you. Possibly, you have an inclination for extreme behavior; at least you have a strong desire to constantly have new erotic experiences, which in fact do impart insights. Never forget to be considerate of the feelings of your partner.



Any kind of limits present you with a challenge. Jupiter embodies the principle of expansion, and the eighth house tries to overcome and use natural limitations. You may be interested in existential questions, which arouse so much fear in other people that they are commonly suppressed. The depth of your thoughts gives you a mysterious aura."
421;RADIX_0000000000131398;Your Jupiter in the Ninth House;"You are constantly looking for insights in answer to your questions about the meaning of life. You think of life as a long journey, which you want to make as interesting as possible. You are always open to new things but never know what is going to come of it. Your optimism should make you popular.



If Jupiter has challenging aspects, you may tend to lecture people and have trouble accepting other opinions. You could lose yourself in complicated theoretical considerations that no one can follow or would even want to. At worst, your behavior could take on a fanatical character and prevent you from seeing reality the way it is. If you are of the opinion that yours is the only valid truth, you will soon find yourself in isolation.



Generally you should be appreciated for your tolerance and openness. Take a look at the world and do not hesitate to spend a longer period of time in a foreign country, it would have a positive effect on your development. It may be in a foreign culture that you find the missing piece of mosaic of your philosophy of life. Never stop learning, which would probably be like brain death to you.



Your ideal profession could be in law, in the travel industry, in education or in publishing."
422;RADIX_0000000000147782;Your Jupiter in the Tenth House;"You want to make a good impression in public. You may make a spectacle about your entrance or sulk if you are not noticed and disappear into the mass. Generally that will not happen because you have an aura of authority, which could almost be considered majestic. Status symbols and other signs of power are very important to you. You require a certain standard of living.



You approach professional challenges with enthusiasm. Somehow you are always sure that you will find a solution to any problem. That may be your secret to success. You should really start a career and climb to a respectable position. You find fulfillment by accepting responsibility for larger endeavors, which further your individuality. You may have a profession which lets you travel, you may be in law or banking. Do not let the key to personal happiness depend on your social position and do not secretly hold people who are not as successful as you in contempt.



In the tenth house you will meet your father. Probably you found him charming and tried to imitate him and may even have taken over his convictions. He may have first brought you into contact with foreign cultures."
423;RADIX_0000000000164166;Your Jupiter in the Eleventh House;"In the eleventh house Jupiter will feel at home because it has enough room to spread its ideas. This constellation means that you will approach people without reservations. You will look for a group with similar convictions with whom you can realize your concept of charity work. You may even end up leading the group. You spend a lot of time worrying about the future and want to do your part towards solving a couple of problems and working to make the future brighter. You could have colorful visions of the future that will convince your friends. Even with your optimism, you should not make the mistake of expecting too much, setting yourself up for disappointment and frustration. Do not lose your grip on reality and do not take slip ups too personally.



Your colorful, diverse group of friends and everything you do together helps you to understand larger contexts and prevents you from getting embittered about life in general. Isolation would probably kill you; you need the exchange of ideas with people who think the way you do. Watch that you do not take on more than you can handle. If you follow this you should always have a feeling for important social and technological developments."
424;RADIX_0000000000180550;Your Jupiter in the Twelfth House;"With Jupiter in the twelfth house you look for the meaning of life deep within you as opposed to out in the world. You do not judge people by their exterior, but direct your gaze to their inner qualities. Your deep belief and unending faith in God will always protect you and guide you in life like an invisible hand. Sometimes you have wondrous insights which people around you are not able to see. Metaphorically, you carry the whole world within you. Hard hits of fate which knock other people off their bearings serve you as a challenge to expand your horizons and deepen your faith. You look for the meaning in everything that happens to you and therefore will never give up.



Your strengths provide you with healing qualities that can guide people with problems to the right path. You may do your charity work behind the scenes or in institutions. You could have the potential to help a lot of people just by being with them.



If you have not developed far enough and are still fighting your way through life, you should definitely avoid every kind of drug. If Jupiter has difficult aspects in the twelfth house, you could have a tendency to make yourself a martyr, because you do not know another way to break out of your isolation."
425;RADIX_0000000000000388;Saturn - The Necessity of Responsibility;"The planet Saturn has a diameter of approximately 110,000 kilometers and circles the Sun at a distance of 1426 million kilometers. Its orbit takes an average of 29 years, which causes it to travel slowly through the astrological chart. Mythology reports that Chronos (Saturn) ate his children because he thought their power hunger would drive them to murder him, as he dethroned his father by killing him. 



In Astrology Saturn is considered the karmic planet. Karma is the law of cause and effect. Saturn makes sure that we are confronted with the consequences of our actions. This is especially true of the Return of Saturn, around the age of 29, when the natal Saturn forms a conjunction with the transiting Saturn. This is the time to reflect on life with all its mistakes and regrets, which may force some corrective actions. Saturn is the past, tradition, the father and restrictive principle. Where Saturn is found, there are regularly problems to be solved, as challenges can be found in every horoscope. We have to overcome fear and inhibitions. As seen positively, Saturn brings consistency, perseverance, diligence and responsibility. It rules the sign Capricorn."
426;RADIX_0000000000000385;Your Saturn in Aries;"Saturn seems to have problems no matter where it is. In Aries, the sign of renewal and unfolding energy for individual goals, Saturn can express itself in one or two ways. 



You may begin an egotistical climb to the top, showing no regard for the feelings and needs of others, whereby you will have difficulty bringing yourself to cooperate with others and be unable to compromise. You press on putting yourself under unbelievable time pressure, which does not accomplish anything anyway, because you get bored fast and lose interest in the results of your work.



The opposite case could also come about, making it hard for you to take the initiative and practice your convictions. Without the support of those around you, you do not dare take even one step and are also anxious about any changes. Risks or any endeavor with an uncertain outcome are to be avoided at all costs. Your exaggerated need to feel secure makes you blind to opportunity letting you see only the dangers of a new development.



Experience will force you to recognize your strengths, use them and teaches you that perseverance and initiative are necessary prerequisites not only for independence, but also for a harmony within a group. Once you have understood this, it will be possible to achieve things you could not have dreamed of before. The combination of self-discipline and creative ideas is the basis for every successful endeavor. You could take on tremendous tasks by setting your determination and persistence towards concrete goals."
427;RADIX_0000000000016769;Your Saturn in Taurus;Quite probably you have an exaggerated need for security and make yourself a slave to your possessions, laboring from dawn until dusk to fill your pension fund and secure your income in your old age. In order to see continued returns on your investments, you avoid risks and incalculable enterprises. Those around you may consider you greedy or stingy. The myriad pleasures of life do not draw your interest. Mineral water quenches thirst just as well as champagne. If you cannot get your way, you get cranky. You may have a tendency to think of others as your property and become overly jealous. Saturn will teach you a couple of lessons in this respect. You are called upon to learn to deal reasonably with various resources and to acknowledge that there can be no absolute security. Maybe you have lost your possessions, have had to start all over and have learned there are not very many things you really need in order to live.  It might also be that people start avoiding you because they do not want to let themselves be encompassed by you. This will eventually bring you to acknowledge the free will of each individual. Personal experience will teach you to enjoy life. By dealing with possessions sensibly, you will lose your fear of the future and be able to work persistently and still enjoy yourself in the evenings. The world of finance may be the best place to look for success.
428;RADIX_0000000000033153;Your Saturn in Gemini;"Quite possibly, you are excessively working yourself up to sense an unhealthy distrust of everyone. You always look for depth and the sense in something and are not capable of laughing over a simple joke. Social circles where people just play around and enjoy each other do not interest you. This makes it difficult for you to meet people and leaves you feeling frustrated. Problems with neighbors and siblings can prove to be inevitable because you have not mastered the art of light conversation. This may be due to a speech disorder or you may not feel confident enough to say a lot in a group. You think of yourself as uneducated and admire people who have lots of friends and get to know people easily.



No matter which problems arise, your experiences will not be in vain. The lessons of life will discipline your thinking so you can solve the most complicated problems. Logical thinking is one of your strong points, enabling people to trust your judgment. Because your knowledge was acquired through a lot of work, it would make sense for you to put it to sensible use. The natural sciences, teaching or bookkeeping may interest you. Continuing education could give you the confidence you need to relax when approaching people."
429;RADIX_0000000000049537;Your Saturn in Cancer;"The position of Saturn tells that your childhood was not especially happy and that you had a number of problems with your parents. They may have been very strict and incapable of providing warmth and security. For this reason it is still difficult for you to learn to show your feelings and let people get close to you. You may be repeating the mistakes of your parents and find it difficult to create a loving atmosphere in your family. You tend to hide behind your shell and lose contact to your environment. Maybe you withdraw alone at home because being out in public makes you feel insecure. Or you may be oversensitive and get thrown off by the slightest criticism.



The responsibilities of family life and the organization of family affairs are your responsibilities. Even if it proves to be extremely difficult, you are going to have to learn to open yourself up, at least to those closest to you. This could create barriers to establishing your own family. A family will eventually know your needs and problems intimately and be able to change your behavior and show you genuine affection. Once these barriers are overcome, it will be easy for you to take responsibility for your family and be a source of support for them."
430;RADIX_0000000000065921;Your Saturn in Leo;"Most probably, you have problems presenting yourself, which can be expressed in a number of ways. An overdeveloped desire for prestige could be responsible for your tendency to make a fuss over yourself trying to attract attention. If no one notices you, you are insulted. In addition you want to be in control of everything and tell others what to do. Responsibility for failures is easily shoved onto someone else due to your reluctance to accept your own weaknesses. And probably you find if difficult to follow generally accepted rules, insisting on special treatment for yourself.



Saturn in Leo can bring about inhibitions against showing your real personality. You probably like to disappear in the crowd so that no one even notices that you are there, because you have not yet found any way to express your creativity. You may suffer from inferiority complexes.



Experiences in this area will cause you to spend a lot of time thinking about your role in the community until you have found a suitable place. Eventually your self-confidence will develop to such an extent that no one will be able to take it from you. Your awareness of the value of friends and social acceptance prevents you from risking them through reckless behavior. To avoid any further mistakes in this area, examine your place in society critically. You might also consider business an area where you could be quite successful."
431;RADIX_0000000000082305;Your Saturn in Virgo;"You could become a champion of work, suffering martyrdom for others. Possibly, you accept only your own work because you know that you do everything better anyway. Others only draw your constant criticism, which makes for a tense atmosphere on the job. Perfectionism and following the rules too strictly leave no room for improvisation and new ideas. Letting go to enjoy life for a change is not easy for you because if you are not able to help out somehow, you feel useless. After quitting time you continue working to keep your house presentable. Continually overloading both your body and mind will eventually result in an involuntary period of rest in a sickbed.



Knowledge gained from experience will enable you to use what you have learned effectively making you a valued colleague. Once you have managed to overcome the divisions between the body and soul and realize the value of a stable state of health, you can serve as an example to others. You pay attention to your body signals and keep yourself in shape. Anyone in need knows they can count on you because you take great pleasure in helping others.



Professionally, you might want to go into the field of health. Your conscientiousness and precision make you suited for work in scientific research, bookkeeping or in a technical field."
432;RADIX_0000000000098689;Your Saturn in Libra;"The area of human relationships could prove to be difficult for you; although you are actually in search of peace and harmony, you do not feel comfortable approaching strangers and are on edge in group situations. Conflicts in partnerships can end with no one willing to give in. You may have too many expectations of your partner and not realize that you are not always the easiest person to live with. It is also possible that you simply are not prepared to accept responsibility and fulfill your obligations. You may be attracted to people who try to control you and are always telling you what to do.



No matter what kind of experiences you have in this area, they will make a new person out of you. Once you have found out that cooperation among equals can produce valuable results, you will become an example to others. People will value you because they can depend on you and know that you would never make promises you cannot deliver. People also often ask you for advice due to your keen sense of justice, which you are more than happy to give. Maintaining relationships is one of the obligations your pronounced loyalty will not let you neglect. Someday you will have a prestigious position and earn a lot of money. You are aware of your social responsibility and will share this knowledge with others."
433;RADIX_0000000000115073;Your Saturn in Scorpio;"Stubbornness can drive you into ruin, just to prevent you from following a well-intended piece of advice. You take nothing lightly, looking for depth and meaning in everything, whereby you unfortunately tend to exaggerate and act selfishly. In place of a jovial sense of humor, you prefer irony and sarcasm, which gives the impression that you are embittered and often intimidates others. Perhaps you are a fatalist and unable to believe in anything. You have yet to discover your spiritual power. You demand a lot from others and can toil until you collapse from exhaustion in order to achieve your ambitions. Conflicts over financial matters or inheritance could get the better of you. Sometimes you even resort to dishonest means, which causes some people to stay out of your way.



But it does not have to get that far. If you draw the right consequences from your experience, things will brighten up. You can handle all resources responsibly, whether they belong to you or not. When necessary, you can help someone out financially and get them back on their feet. You have an eye for finances and could find a profession in a bank, in commerce or in tax assessment. Your endurance and self-discipline should carry you to success. With your iron will you should be able to achieve any goal you set for yourself."
434;RADIX_0000000000131457;Your Saturn in Sagittarius;"Probably you have firm principles and views, which you do not like to put in question. This has brought you to preach on occasion doing your best to convince other people of your convictions. You can be very intolerant, especially in religious questions, rejecting those with other beliefs. You take your continuing education in philosophy very seriously, which is a shame because it could be a lot of fun. Getting recognition for your intellectual activity is very important to you, but be careful not to become too conceited. You may even imagine that you have found the ultimate truth, leading you to reject any new ideas and try to preserve everything in its current state.



These are problems arising from Saturn in Sagittarius. Your experiences and the consequences you draw from them will lead you to the positive qualities of this Saturn position. You are capable of deep thoughts and great discoveries that shape your perspective. You like to share your realizations with others and are able to keep away from appearing arrogant. You value justice over everything and work intensively on humanitarian questions. Your high level of education is the result of a lot of hard work, whereby you make sure that all the knowledge you acquire can be applied to practice. If you could hold onto your sense of humor you would probably be an excellent teacher or lawyer."
435;RADIX_0000000000147841;Your Saturn in Capricorn;"You show great endurance and determination that should enable you to take on a prestigious position. A career is crucial for your ambitions to gain respect and make a reputation for yourself. You may even walk over bodies on your way to the top and feel contempt for anyone who does not set their goals as high as you do. You can make an embittered, overworked, and humorless impression, such that you are not able to enjoy your victories. If you overemphasize your self-control, no one may be able to find their way into your inner world. You will then find yourself isolated and lacking emotion.



The lessons of Saturn in Capricorn will open the positive side of its position. This could be expressed strongly because Saturn is in the sign it rules. You have a great power of concentration and can do a lot for the society in which you live. Never let your work lose its relation to practice if you want to realize your ambitions. People are generally willing to give you recognition for your efforts and you especially appreciate being able to provide others with a feeling of security. A respect for traditional values, such as responsibility, finds its expression in conservative convictions. You are a tireless worker, who earns every success honestly and would never allow yourself to be used. There is no reason for problems with your boss to arise because you are willing to take orders and remain loyal. It would be better if you learned to express your feelings at least to those closest to you, also try to make life more fun. If Saturn receives harmonious aspects, you should become an honorable and successful person. Use your experience to support people who want to establish a professional existence. You could set things in motion, especially in politics."
436;RADIX_0000000000164225;Your Saturn in Aquarius;"You pursue your ideals seriously and have been known to overdo it on occasion. You speak of humanity and brotherhood, still Aquarius is an air sign and Saturn's presence can cause you to leave a cold, distant impression on people. Socializing may be nothing more to you than a means to present your uniqueness and originality to an audience. The people around you may react harshly to your criticism; even good friends may become obstinate and disagreeable. Even when you take on great humanitarian goals, never forget who you are and to place your own integrity in doubt.



After accepting your lessons from Saturn and also having withstood all the necessary challenges, you will get to know the positive qualities of this Saturn position. At this point, people can be happy to be able to call you their friend. People will trust you, because you keep your promises and always show high regard for your friend's feelings. People appreciate the way you pay attention to the practical details of your projects intended to introduce concrete improvements. You are determined, but thoroughly prepared. You place the needs of the many above your own needs and are prepared to take responsibility for your own existence and act on it. You are well-known for your helpfulness because you know what you are talking about."
437;RADIX_0000000000180609;Your Saturn in Pisces;"It may be that you withdraw yourself in search of solitude a little too often in order to get a grip on your problems. Unfortunately, you have a tendency to wallow in self-pity, convinced that the world is an evil place and at fault so that you cannot be as cheerful as others can. You also may direct your attention mainly to the past, disregarding the future. You feel weak and are dissatisfied with your life. You do not have the courage to introduce changes or to look reality square in the face. It could get so bad as to manifest itself in anxiety and nightmares.



The experience of this Saturn position can be instructive enough to put you on the right track. Once you have overcome yourself and have gotten control over your life, you will be amazed at your own qualities and talents. Your sensitivity will enable you to help people in need in ways that will lead them to achieve independence. You have found your faith and can draw a lot of strength from it. This gives you the security and confidence to meet new people. With your inspiration and imagination, you could use creativity to strive towards the most beautiful ambitions. You may seriously dedicate yourself to esoteric fields that bring you deep insights."
438;RADIX_0000000001835394;Your Saturn in Conjunction with Your Uranus;"Even if you recognize that there are things in life which have already served their purpose, you do not find it necessary to go to great lengths to tear out their foundations. A profession in the field of science or mathematics would suit you well. If esoteric fields entice you, then it would be a good idea to take a closer look at Astrology; you will not regret it.



There is something that you should be careful of, namely the danger of taking on a very authoritarian attitude. This may come from an experience or a feeling that causes you to sense a threat to your personal security. There may be severe attitudes lurking within you. Become more aware of your tendency to scare people off with your pessimistic and unrealistic attitudes. If you manage that, nothing will stand in the way of the creative life you have been dreaming of."
439;RADIX_0000000002097538;Your Saturn in Conjunction with Your Neptune;"If this conjunction has a positive influence as seen within the context of your entire chart, you will be capable of developing psychic abilities, which will provide you with an overview not only of your own conduct but also of the conduct of others. An understanding of the fundamental regulating principles of all life in the universe allows you to offer assistance to less fortunate people.



The planet Neptune represents dreams and fantasies, while Saturn is more concerned with the energy forms whose manifestation is more concrete. This will allow you to devote your attention to creative endeavors. However, it will not be easy to realize Neptune's ideal because the path leading there may be clouded by illusions. For this reason, you should be careful not to act too secretively or you will gradually lose sight of reality."
440;RADIX_0000000002359682;Your Saturn in Conjunction with Your Pluto;"Remaining conscious of your ambitions and being certain that you will achieve them gives you an inner drive that lets you devote all your energy and experience to a goal. In spite of this, you are not interested in publicly proclaiming your plans or becoming the center point of a project. Probably you will have to restrict yourself somewhat, but you are prepared for it, even though it is hard for you to imagine that everything will go smoothly.



Within your environment, you are able to make yourself be heard and your influence on others can be far reaching, especially because this demands patience and hard work, which you enjoy. Watch out that your egotistical tendencies do not get in the way of your ambitions, even if this seems improbable.



Because you are informed of the motives of the people around you, others come to you for advice, especially when it comes to differentiating between right and wrong. Although your harsh judgments have made you famous, you remain just and incorruptible. In the course of your life, you could save enough to be able to devote the later years of your life to creative pursuits."
441;RADIX_0000000008388994;Your Saturn in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;An amazing amount of stamina helps you to pursue your goals without accepting help. It is important to you to earn your way through honest work. When things do not go right, you take a close look at the cause in order to avoid making the same mistake twice. Maybe you will have to take some restrictions into account, but that will help you on your way. People respect you because you never neglect your responsibilities and your conscientiousness. Avoiding risks has always proven to be the right thing to do. Out of a need for stability within yourself, you will restructure your life, possibly with the help of your father.
442;RADIX_0000000009175426;Your Saturn in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;You are certainly capable of going about your work with discipline and meticulous planning. People know they can rely on you and when it comes to taking on responsibility, your colleagues and others prefer to ask you for advice in spite of your tendency to make a shy, introverted impression. If you are not careful, people could interpret this quality negatively, even if it does not make any sense to you. Basically, people see you as being responsible. If you are able to overcome your lack of self-confidence, which is really only a pretense you could achieve more. Maybe you have to learn first that perfection does not exist among human beings and that personal integrity is a worthier goal.
443;RADIX_0000000009437570;Your Saturn in Conjunction with Your MC;"Professional success is ensured by a lot of hard work and self-discipline. Determination and high energy assure the realization of your ambitions. A strong sense of responsibility makes you a respected manager. You are known for setting high goals but remaining fair. You are also in a position to remember the future consequences of your conduct.



The discipline your father taught you may have been a great encouragement to your character development, although it may have seemed like torture to you at the time. Still, it is better to avoid making such statements based on the interpretation of a single aspect without considering the rest of your chart."
444;RADIX_0000000001851778;Your Saturn in Opposition with Your Uranus;"Avoid giving others the impression that you are a hypocrite, and demand more from others than you are capable of giving. Although you need a lot of freedom and make use of it, you are usually not very cooperative when it comes to granting freedom to others. It may be due to your lack of humility, that you are unable to admit your mistakes. The mix of inconsequent and authoritarian behavior can confuse people. You could wind up isolated before an understanding can be reached.



Maybe your present state of confusion expresses itself in an extreme idealistic philosophy, which meets a lot of resistance in society.



If you receive a professional promotion, you could have problems with your colleagues in leadership positions, because they reject you and act contrary to your direction. If you accept a subordinate position, your boss may find ways to torment you.



Until you learn to be patient, you will never be capable of continuing achievements. This aspect depends on acquiring clear and logical reason, which should enable you to organize your life efficiently. If you can ever manage to get your nasty moods under control, you will feel a lot better."
445;RADIX_0000000002113922;Your Saturn in Opposition with Your Neptune;"There is a danger that your innate distrust could prevent you from getting close to anyone. The many anxieties that you suffer are actually unfounded because they are based on past experiences and took place under circumstances that no longer exist. Actually you withdraw because you fear making a mistake. Is not it true that people learn better through effectively managing a crisis? This is not getting you anywhere; you could end up completely isolated in some niche in society, and if you are not careful, you could even find yourself in the clutches of some suspicious character.



Get out and work for that which is important to you; this will earn you respect and enable to you approach people and talk to them when conflicts arise and clear up misunderstandings. If you prefer the life of a loner, it would do you good to ask yourself why. If you cannot overcome your depressive attitude, it could manifest itself psychosomatically in physical symptoms."
446;RADIX_0000000002376066;Your Saturn in Opposition with Your Pluto;"You should be careful not to let yourself be victimized by con artists; you run the risk of getting entangled in questionable activities. The best way to protect yourself is to keep an overview of what is going on around you. If some day you suddenly realize that it is better to be honest; hopefully, it will not be too late.



Still, you are often gullible and are easily impressed by people who promise to bring you the stars from heaven. It is high time for you to develop some common sense, which, of course, is easier said than done. Because you often find yourself in crisis situations, you should use them to develop a more relaxed attitude in dealing with people. This is also true for conflicts at work, which at times can pile up overwhelmingly."
447;RADIX_0000000008405378;Your Saturn in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;"Relationships are often characterized by inhibitions because it is not easy for you to talk openly about your feelings. Disappointments in connection with the house affairs where Saturn is found will diffuse your energy and rob you of your courage. Undoubtedly you will withstand some of your tests but what is important is your ability to resolve your past. Maybe you should analyze the guilt complexes you are carrying around with you.



Probably your father had a lot of influence on your view of the world and placed high expectations on you. He may have been strict and cold-hearted, which is why you never felt accepted and were not able to develop the self-confidence necessary to approach tasks in a relaxed state. If you learn to accept your own weaknesses and those of other people, you will see a lot of changes in your life."
448;RADIX_0000000009191810;Your Saturn in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"You seem to be quite capable of going about your work with discipline and meticulous planning, the only thing which keeps getting in your way are your own inhibitions. Learn to assert yourself because you have talents that you are not aware of. Because of this tendency, you make a shy and introverted impression.



Sometimes you can be so overcautious that you miss out on opportunities. You may be cool and distant. These qualities could also be interpreted negatively, even if you are not able to follow the arguments. Because most people are satisfied with your reliability, you should be able to overcome your deficit of self-confidence.



Maybe you have to learn that there is no human perfection and that personal integrity is a worthier goal."
449;RADIX_0000000009453954;Your Saturn in Opposition with Your MC;"Your childhood may have been characterized by restrictions that prevented you from leading a satisfying and happy life. For this reason feelings, of inadequacy prevent you from devoting yourself to your work.



Maybe your parents were very dominating. They might have drilled you for perfection and now you think of yourself as a failure because you feel inept to fulfill your own expectations let alone those of your parents. The solution is to lower your expectations a little; nobody is perfect.



It may be that your parents fought a lot, whereby you may be closer to one parent and are forced to argue in favor of a certain position or to defend yourself."
450;RADIX_0000000001868162;Your Saturn in Square with Your Uranus;"The outcome of this aspect will be determined by the relative strength of the two planets in your chart, but it will still make sure that your conservative ideology collides with your energies that are striving for reform. If Saturn is dominant, you will try to prevent change by standing in the way of all reforms and innovative influences in society and politics. If Uranus is stronger, you will oppose the existing circumstances. In either case, you will have to avoid taking on a too rigid position because this could arouse the indignation of others.



Finally, you are called on to find the golden mean, then if you stand in the way of changes, your foundation will not necessarily be safe from destruction. If you instigate drastic reforms, you may have to wait a long time for any signs of success. This is because you simply do not have enough experience to go about putting your ideas into practice. Before you find yourself, you may take on authoritarian characteristics and maybe also seem eccentric. If you do not do something about it, you may find yourself isolated, which you probably want to avoid. Do something for the development of your common sense, which will help you to act appropriately at the right moment."
451;RADIX_0000000002130306;Your Saturn in Square with Your Neptune;"Even if you find it very difficult to keep your life in perspective, you should make a conscious effort before problems growing out of your inconsequent behavior win the overhand. Sometimes fears stemming from your subconsciousness trip you up. When you take a closer look, you will see that there is no concrete basis for these fears, which serve no other purpose than to prevent you from living a satisfying life.



Your professional activities could get chaotic, even reaching the point where you are ready to run away from your obligations, although even that will not help. Someday you are going to have to find a way to reasonably come to terms with reality. Do your best to make sure that you are honest in setting your goals. Have confidence in your abilities, even if it seems like everything you do is a disaster. That is not so tragic because only by analyzing barriers will you find out how to go about making your life more successful. Once you have achieved that, your self-confidence will be in better shape and you will finally be able to recognize and appreciate your own competence."
452;RADIX_0000000002392450;Your Saturn in Square with Your Pluto;"Sometimes you could believe that all the burdens of the universe rest on your shoulders and cannot get rid of the feeling that you have been treated unfairly. If you start to whine about your fate, then it is time to take a closer look at reality and see that the problem may lie in the way you go about things. Maybe you were a notorious coward as a child, who avoided every confrontation at the slightest chance of defeat.



Learn to open up to others and talk about your weaknesses; you would not be living on this planet if you were perfect. You may be lacking personal integrity, but there is no reason to withdraw from social challenges, because you have a lot of potential that only requires more confidence. What you need is someone who can give you advice and help to bring out your talents. With a little help, you will be able to take on the challenges and responsibilities, especially if you do not let yourself be driven by a desire to manipulate the lives of others."
453;RADIX_0000000008421762;Your Saturn in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;"Probably life will offer you many tests and not just enjoyment. Restrictions may force you to work hard and persevere, taking on responsibility for yourself and others. Possibly you will have to get along for much of your life on your own. Still do not despair and wallow in self-pity, lamenting over the injustice of the world, but rise to challenges and explore the meaning of life. This will make you successful and allows you to look toward the future from a stable foundation. Live by the motto: ""If it does not kill me, it will make me stronger."""

In the course of your life, you will join groups to coordinate energies for a collective platform. Diplomacy is definitely an advantage here."
457;RADIX_0000000002146690;Your Saturn in Trine with Your Neptune;"With this aspect you will have the ability to take on great responsibility, whereby you have a pronounced need to change unacceptable social conditions. Probably you were strongly influenced by your parents' moral and ethical values, which is why you have a lot of understanding and sympathy for others. An extreme sensitive perception prevents even the most insignificant occurrences from escaping your notice.



Professionally, you are distinguished by your intelligent and honest conduct. You are convinced that straying from the path of virtue may satisfy the ego or lead to material wealth in the short-term, but does not get you where you want to be. Being conscientious earns you the recognition and respect of others. Because pictures burned into celluloid are associated with Neptune, you could go into creative photography.



Frequently, others envy you for your power of concentration that allows you to intuitively grasp the fundamental principles of life and to make use of them. In this respect you are well aware of the law of cause and effect as well as its hold on yourself and your environment. Many talents come together in you, whether you choose to awaken them or not remains entirely up to you, but it would be desirable."

Possibly you have the curse of constantly lucking out, just do not let yourself depend on it. It would be better if all of life's challenges do not always come to a happy end all by themselves, giving you reason to engage your hidden talents."

Determination and high energy assure the realization of your ambitions. A strong sense of responsibility makes you a respected manager, you are known for setting high goals but remaining fair. You are also in a position to remember the future consequences of your conduct.



In spite all of this, you also are able to avoid neglecting your private sphere, which is greatly appreciated. You are very much aware of your traditional responsibilities and will take loving care of your parents in their old age."
468;RADIX_0000000000000390;Your Saturn in the First House;"There is something keeping you from taking on life and really devoting your spirit to your work. You are inhibited. When a good opportunity arises, you usually hesitate too long. Often you sense specific fears for the future and completely doubt your ability to tackle everything coming your way. You may draw negative experiences to yourself, like a flame attracts moths. Someday you are going to have to recognize the necessity of taking on the challenge. Your present attitude only serves to make life more difficult.



Even if you had a difficult childhood with lots of restrictions, you alone hold the key to your happiness. Do not try to make anyone else responsible for your life. Ask yourself first what the events have to do with you. Your high expectations may actually be a hindrance to your efforts.



Sometimes Saturn expresses itself in the first house by making it hard to accept other people's limitations. You may want to dictate how other people should live their lives. You are always a little stiff and neglect fun because you believe that responsibilities come first.



In any case, you should activate your positive energies and be more optimistic. Every difficulty harbors a potential for further development."
469;RADIX_0000000000016774;Your Saturn in the Second House;"You have a strong need for security and are convinced that you can avoid the dangers of this world by piling up material possessions and achieving financial security. This can become compulsive and eventually get in the way of your social contacts, which would provide you with approval and make you feel contented. You may even fear that someone is after your horde of goods. You are constantly wary of losing interest or of collapses in the stock market rates. You do not notice the beauty that life has to offer and do not realize what you are missing. Maybe you compensate for your fear of failure at social contacts with your sense of achievement, your pride at having built something and your independence of people, who you consider unreliable anyway. Do not delude yourself.



Eventually you are going to have to fight financial battles and accept some restrictions. It may well be that you grew up in a poor family and now overemphasize material possessions. Do not let it go so far as to measure the worth of a person by her bank account.



Seen positively you know the value of other people's creations and productions and would never waste resources. You approach the realization of your ambitions with enthusiasm and stamina. Your ambitions are always within reach so that during the course of your life, you will become even more relaxed."
470;RADIX_0000000000033158;Your Saturn in the Third House;"With Saturn in the third house, it will not be easy for you to find the right words for the various situations you find yourself in, or to express yourself adequately. Communication is always a challenge that you should take on. Even if you hesitate to approach people and talk to strangers, your positive experiences in this area will be helpful to you.



Be aware that people rely on language as a means of communication. It will not help to reject the intellect and refuse to work on correcting a deficit. You are probably intellectually more developed than you seem to be, simply because your language skills are deficient.



In your childhood, learning probably was not much fun and you did not feel comfortable in school. Problems with siblings and feelings of inadequacy may be what is still keeping you from simply expressing your thoughts. Possibly your parents handicapped your development by denying you freedom to experiment thus robbing you of your drive to discover your environment with a child's natural curiosity. Whatever it may have been, you can transform your weaknesses into strengths. Be tactful and learn verbal expression by reading and being a part of your social environment. Even superficial contacts are important and will enrich your life."
471;RADIX_0000000000049542;Your Saturn in the Fourth House;"With this constellation you have experienced emotional or economic restrictions in your childhood. Your family probably was unable to convey the necessary self-esteem that has left you insecure today. You are looking for stability and do not trust your abilities. Get to work on your self-confidence, if you have not started already.



Probably your parents did not provide you with the warmth every child needs, and based their child-rearing on strictly regimenting behavior. Possibly you got the feeling that you were unwanted and developed a guilt complex for having been born. Now you have a difficult task before you, namely discovering your own worth and accepting yourself. Once you succeed, everyone else will finally know whom they are dealing with.



You may have had major conflicts with your father. He was probably very strict and punished you for little things, leaving you constantly in fear of him and feeling that you are doing everything wrong. If you have the opportunity to clear up these problems with your father, it would be beneficial to you.



Hopefully, you will not repeat the mistakes your parents made and shower your children with the warmth and love you never had. In this way, you could alleviate your difficulties and develop a self-confidence that no one will be able to take away from you."
472;RADIX_0000000000065926;Your Saturn in the Fifth House;"It is not easy for you to present yourself and to express your own creativity. Probably things would be different if you were able to imagine the limitless possibilities within yourself. You do not take advantage of the freedom that every individual on the planet possesses, because you are afraid of doing something wrong. You even manage to make what would normally be a pleasant undertaking competitive. It is no wonder that you seem tense and put yourself under pressure.



Even on the rare occasions when you allow yourself to engage in romance, you approach the matter quite seriously. You may have frightened off potential partners because you started talking about marriage during the first round of flirting. You just cannot lie back and enjoy life. You think that everything you do has to have a concrete purpose. You are insecure about letting others in on your inner self and your fantasies.



You will find the causes of this behavior in your childhood. Maybe your parents expected too much of you and did not allow you to be a child. You did everything to fulfill their expectations and never tried to go your own way and never experimented, because every detail was prescribed and regimented.



You can probably take care of your problems once you have children of your own and manage to give them the freedom you never had. You could then let yourself relive your childhood periodically and make up for some of the experiences you missed the first time around."
473;RADIX_0000000000082310;Your Saturn in the Sixth House;"Work and your daily routine have a special importance to you. Unfortunately, you do not always make it easy on yourself. You put yourself under pressure because your perfectionism demands the highest performance and never gives you a break. You should become conscious of the fact that you will never be able to solve the world's problems and that your exact concept of the way things should be only serves to tie you down. Do not construct your own prison, but do not take everything so seriously.  Learn when it is better to ignore things.



This constellation can be expressed in the other extreme and lead to a rejection of responsibility and a denial of obligations. You fear the restrictions of a steady job and are considered unreliable.



If you run into problems or are dissatisfied with yourself, this will make itself known in the form of a physical illness. You have a tendency to use your body to vent your frustrations in stressful situations, probably because you never willingly take a break.



Take a closer look at the mechanisms at work suppressing your memories to find out what you are actually afraid of. Maybe you are suffering from an unfulfilled romantic passion."
474;RADIX_0000000000098694;Your Saturn in the Seventh House;"You are faced with the challenge of solving problems in personal relationships. You fear contact with other people and think you will be too vulnerable if you open yourself to others.



You may have actually had some bad experiences in your relationships. You usually attract dominant, energetic partners. You become dependent and may even let yourself be tyrannized. You are looking for security and stability in a relationship and sometimes sacrifice your independence for it. Often you are drawn to older partners changing the character to a father-daughter or mother-son relationship as opposed to an equal partnership. Whatever the case, do not complain about your partner, just find out what got you into the relationship and deactivate the mechanism.



Possibly your parents had a troubled marriage and fought a lot. That would explain your hesitation to get into a steady relationship. Maybe you are afraid that a serious relationship will restrict you, either that or you are waiting for your prince or princess.  You probably will not have a satisfying relationship until later in life."
475;RADIX_0000000000115078;Your Saturn in the Eighth House;"With Saturn in the eighth house you fear losing control over your emotions and live withdrawn and isolated. You do not try to give a partner a chance to fulfill your need for love and devotion. You probably have problems with sexuality, which are expressed in prudishness and lack of understanding for the importance of sex.



Sometimes you do not think thoughts through to the end, which you cannot get out of your mind, or you deny recognizing the answer to existential questions. You will not open yourself to the principle of constant giving and taking, which no one can live without, because you fear losing your individuality. Fear is the driving factor in your life. If you do not overcome it, you will become more and more isolated. You should learn to place your resources at the disposal of others, because you can only profit by it. It is not beneath your worth to accept offers from others without asking what is expected in return. If you try to manipulate or dominate people too often, it could have bitter consequences.



In principle, you are concerned with only one topic: detachment. You have to find your natural strengths and accept the flow of life. Even if you find it disturbing, you should confront the concept of death and accept it as the threshold to another existence.



You can be professionally active working with other people's finances, for example, in banking or in the stock market. If you get entangled in conflicts, then avoid going to court; that will only make things worse."
476;RADIX_0000000000131462;Your Saturn in the Ninth House;"When you look into religion, philosophy or higher education, you have a dogmatic approach. This can go so far that performing a specific ceremony may be more important than its actual content. You would make a good fanatical missionary, who wants to spread the faith without considering the consequences or who finds fulfillment in ascetic behavior. Never forget the principle of brotherly love, which in one way or another is a part of every religion.



Your convictions could lead you to push your outdated morality onto yourself and others, because you reject our present social development and its accompanying individualism. You may have never come to know the spiritual freedom that is associated with the ninth house, because your parents had fixed ideas about how their child should go through life. Unfortunately, you have a tendency to see future developments in a negative light and deny yourself opportunities.



Possibly you have developed in the opposite direction and reject belief, moral, ethics and law, because you live by your own rules. It would do you good to clear your head and address the basic questions of existence, whereby the character trait, tolerance, would suit you well."
477;RADIX_0000000000147846;Your Saturn in the Tenth House;"The tenth house is the natural home of the planet Saturn, which is why its influence here is especially pronounced. You are known for your superhuman stamina, but you should watch out or inappropriate self-confidence could become a trap. Take a look at your weaknesses periodically, and do not be too quick to judge others.



You want to be respected and are willing to work to achieve status. Your ambition is to do something that will have a lasting impact, like constructing buildings, or founding an administration. It is not difficult for you to sacrifice because you do not place much importance on fun anyway. You follow a clearly defined goal and will do everything to achieve it. Just do not make the mistake of using others as instruments of your ambitions.



Saturn with negative aspects could point to difficulties on the social level, whereby it may take a long time for you to find your niche in life. You may have to deal with a few failures at work.



Your father influenced your values significantly, even if he did seem to be strict and without feeling. You could still feel that you have to prove something to him by your achievements.



You would like to be an example and have great discipline and powers of concentration. Seldom do you run the risk of losing your grip on reality, which is why you should at least experience satisfaction at work."
478;RADIX_0000000000164230;Your Saturn in the Eleventh House;"You can run into difficulties joining a group. Although you feel a need to bind with others, this is precisely when your problematic side shows itself. You may feel inhibited and feel inferior to others or you fear that too many new experiences could throw you off your bearings. You may be convinced of the need to conform and are in danger of losing your individuality. In any case, you should stay in contact to others. This will guide you to the most important realizations. Only if you continue to participate in the social group and learn to open yourself up will you be able to get rid of your compulsive behavior.



Be aware that good friends would never ask for more than you are allowed to expect from them. You should be more easy-going with your friends. What could possibly happen that could be so terrible?



Once you have found your own way, you could achieve a lot and also serve as an example for reliability and responsible behavior. You will initiate projects that strive for serious reforms and shape the future. You put humanity first. Your concept of reality will help you to achieve your ambitions."
479;RADIX_0000000000180614;Your Saturn in the Twelfth House;"With Saturn in the twelfth house, you need more sleep than other people and are uneasy about getting to know the unexplored side of your personality. 



You refuse to look deep within yourself, although you know that it is the best way to overcome your fears. Possibly you have nightmares or a deep-rooted guilt complex. You also have problems with loneliness; you may often withdraw from others or try to avoid being alone with yourself, because you get depressed. You always try to keep control over your feelings, although it is not necessary because you could not express anything but understandable human emotions.



Try to overcome your pessimism; it is only turning you into your own enemy. You should learn trust and try to get a handle on your fear of failure or one day you may find yourself in institutions such as hospitals, prisons, or homes or you may earn your living working there.



Once you have accepted all the sides of your personality and have learned to deal with your fears, you will be capable of deep feelings and of finding fulfillment in helping weaker people. You will not be satisfied with superficialities and have a large store of energy from which you can nourish your consciousness of being part of something greater."
480;RADIX_0000000000000452;Uranus - The Process of Emancipation;"The planet Uranus was first discovered in March 1781, at a time when in Europe old structures were breaking down and France stood on the verge of revolution. Its diameter is 49.000 kilometers and it takes 84 years to orbit the sun, taking about 7 years to cross through an astrological sign. In Mythology Uranus was Saturn's father, who castrated him and produced many terrible children. 



In Astrology Uranus denotes a break with tradition as well as new development; it is spirit, intuition and spontaneity. Its position in the chart tells us about our relationships with our friends as well as our attitude toward authority. Uranus can also bring about a revolution and can destroy that which it cannot improve. Uranus rules the sign Aquarius."
481;RADIX_0000000000000449;Your Uranus in Aries;"With the planet Uranus in the sign Aries you are at least 60 years old and grew up during World War II. At least in Germany, this generation was forced head out to find new paths.

 

This Uranus position helps you to develop a strong will to gain intellectual independence. Refusing to tolerate any interference whatsoever, you make your own decisions and draw your own conclusions. An autonomous spirit empowers you to explore the truth with no reservations. Outdated ideas and methods are dropped if they cannot be proven true.



If Uranus in Aries is receiving challenging aspects from other planets, they can be vehement. You may be drawn to rather unreal ideologies or may be quick to use aggression. Generally, you say whatever comes to your mind.



To live in contentment, you require a steady stream of new impulses or adventures in which you can prove yourself. People may accuse you of being explosive. When people start referring to you as a choleric, it will be time to put more effort into cooperating with other people and taking their interests into consideration.



It is possible, that you will lose your perspective of societal structures by continually placing your own ego first. This could prove to be detrimental to your plans for changing the world according to your own concepts. A higher development will provide you with the ability to combine spiritual energies and ethical ideals."
482;RADIX_0000000000016833;Your Uranus in Taurus;"From the year 1935 until 1942, Uranus was in the sign Taurus. Its generation was born during the turmoil of the war and endeavors to actively prevent that kind of disaster from ever being repeated. One measure they suggest is to redistribute the material resources of the planet according to humanitarian criteria. You show imaginative determination in your endeavors that can make you successful.



Although you are attached to possessions and are constantly collecting things, you have an unorthodox relationship to them. The spontaneous element of the planet Uranus in Taurus can express itself in sudden changes in your financial situation. The problem is that you have an appreciation for life's comforts and need to feel secure, on the other hand you want to protect your independence in order to live according to your principles. If Uranus receives negative aspects, you could glorify progress to the point where you throw traditional values overboard."
483;RADIX_0000000000033217;Your Uranus in Gemini;"Uranus in Gemini describes a generation with its own innovative way of thinking, especially in the arts and sciences. You may belong to the forerunners of educational methods and become active in research. Also the world of media interests you, you enjoy the diversity in this area already evident in your life.



You probably have a lot of good ideas, but have difficulties realizing them. You get bored quickly, are distracted by new endeavors and do not have the perseverance to stick with one task long enough to get it done. Uranus was in Gemini from 1942 until 1949, so that no statements should be made without consulting the rest of the chart.



If Uranus in Gemini receives challenging aspects, you can easily overexert yourself in too many different activities. You should choose a few areas instead of being content with rather deficient competence in a lot of different areas."
484;RADIX_0000000000049601;Your Uranus in Cancer;"Uranus was in Cancer from 1949 until 1955 so that the rest of the chart should be consulted before any concrete statements can be made. Generally, this planet position stands for moodiness and emotional irresponsibility, also for original communal living. That generation tried to leave home relatively early and realize its own ideals. This caused a generational conflict, and consequently an intensive exchange. New ideas about home and family were developed and exchanged and women reconsidered their role in society. Family structures changed because every individual demanded more freedom for its own growth. Siblings, parents and other relatives were also expected to befriend each other in order to get along. The negative aspects occurred amidst the confusion because useful traditions were thrown overboard as well as pointless constraints.



If Uranus has a challenging aspect, your family life may be prone to sudden changes, which, most certainly, will not always be easy to deal with."
485;RADIX_0000000000065985;Your Uranus in Leo;"The planet Uranus in Leo represents the generation that was born from 1955 to 1962. Its members attempted to loosen concepts of love and sexuality, and may still want to. Sexuality was discussed openly for the first time causing several taboos to bite the dust. Tradition and strict regulations gave way to kindness and individuality. Free love, whatever that may be, could be a synonym for Uranus in Leo. There was a lot of experimentation in this area. However, after the AIDS virus made its way into the public consciousness, there is less clarity about the ideal form of love. You will have to find your own way of dealing with your passions in this age.



You command originality and resolution on every level of expression. When you entered the world, art was revolutionized, which may explain your interest in this area.



In Leo Uranus finds its exile, thus you should keep your egotistical and narcissistic tendencies in check and work creatively towards finding a solution to the urgent global problems rapidly becoming more threatening. Today it is becoming increasingly more important for a larger percentage of the population to understand that we should preserve life on this planet for our children."
486;RADIX_0000000000082369;Your Uranus in Virgo;"Your generation (from 1962 until 1968) is in a position to revolutionize employment structures and develop a new understanding of service to one's neighbor. On the way to an individual interpretation, the house position of Uranus and the receiving aspects should also be taken into consideration. Generally, it can be said that you may be interested in medical research and working for more rights in the workplace. The equality of the sexes must be emphasized within this context. You will use your humanitarian principles to make progress in union work and to develop new more benevolent technologies. You are good with computers and can no longer imagine your workplace without one.



If Uranus receives negative aspects, you may be prone to sudden physical ailments. It may help to entrust your health to a natural healer because you are skeptical of standard medicine.



Your generation would be especially well suited to work for the ecological regeneration of our planet because the Uranus/Pluto conjunction in Virgo in your chart gives you the imagination to take on global problems. Probably you could create more use for environmentally friendly, naturally grown hemp and develop technical facilities to make it more usable."
487;RADIX_0000000000098753;Your Uranus in Libra;"With the planet Uranus in Libra, you belong to a generation of people who formulated new concepts of relationships and coexistence. You make useful experiences with various partners. A marriage license is no longer important. One belief that is becoming more common is that a man and a woman no longer need a bureaucratic blessing in order to be permitted to love each other. You also accept other forms of sexual preferences because your parents have begun to put taboos to rest.



To get a more individual interpretation of Uranus, consult its house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. Your generation is between 21 and 27 years old today and is interested in alternative living cultures. Some of you live in communes and most have equal relationships.



During this position of Uranus there were great changes in popular music. Computer software has largely replaced orchestras and new styles of music, for example Jamaican reggae, which is oriented on the values of Libra (justice and equality) have come up in this area (Bob Marley is better known today, years after his death than ever before)."
488;RADIX_0000000000115137;Your Uranus in Scorpio;"In your life you will experience many drastic changes which put anything and everything in question. You will experience an unprecedented upheaval when the outdated social systems are cast off. A clearer, more personal interpretation of Uranus can be achieved by consulting its house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. Your generation is between 15 and 20 years old today and probably in favor of less formal forms of communication and interaction.



You will discover abuses and intolerable states of affairs in communal living and be interested in working for the survival of humankind on this planet. The regeneration of raw materials is important; hemp, for example, is one that unfortunately has a reputation for being a dangerous, intoxicating substance. It is no longer being ignored that in Europe, a cultivated plant without THC (the substance responsible for the intoxicating effect) is being planted and can be used for an unbelievable variety of uses. Still, farmers who want to plant it are intimidated both by the bureaucratic barriers and the lack of support from the establishment.



You should try not to let yourselves be led by your feelings and when changes are necessary, do not make such a commotion. Progress is good and important, still things should move harmoniously instead of being played out in extremes. This ensures that everyone can understand what is going on and no one is suddenly blown over."
489;RADIX_0000000000131521;Your Uranus in Sagittarius;"A personal interpretation of this planet position can be obtained by consulting the house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. The generation with Uranus in Sagittarius is today, 1999, between 9 and 17 or between 94 and 100 years old.



Sagittarius stands for the search for new spiritual foundations to prepare for a more advanced form of society. This means higher insight into the role of humanity on the Earth and in the Universe. When Uranus was in Saturn (1982-1989) a ""green"" consciousness was formed for the first time. Since then, green parties have been founded in many countries, which brought many people an alternative to the established political parties.



Uranus in Sagittarius is associated with higher knowledge. This is why a renaissance in esoteric fields can be observed in this time period. Astrology advanced especially quickly, because it is practically applicable.



Finally, it should be mentioned that airplane traffic intensified during this Uranus position (Sagittarius is the sign of long journeys) and the world has gotten smaller. Many people have had experiences with foreign cultures and hope that they left a lasting impression."
490;RADIX_0000000000147905;Your Uranus in Capricorn;"A personal interpretation of this planet position can be obtained by consulting the house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. The generation of Uranus in Capricorn has either just been born continuing up to 9 years of age, or is between 87 and 93 years.



These very young people will participate in significant modifications in politics and economics that will serve to make people aware of their responsibility to their living environment. They want to bring about changes to secure the basis for life also for the coming generations. Capricorn is, among other things, the sign of national political power. The world wide political upheavals between 1989 and 1995 cannot be ignored, nor the detrimental consequences for the communist systems. Uranus is not only about destroying outdated systems, but also about sensible alternatives. In Russia and other former eastern block countries, the changes came about too fast, accounting for the tendencies which are not only positive. Plutonium and Uranium from Soviet stockpiles seem to be easily available today. Under the guise of political unity, an entire city was flattened.



These people with Uranus in Capricorn will be creative researchers and will hopefully dedicate themselves to developing methods to utilize our planet less destructively."
491;RADIX_0000000000164289;Your Uranus in Aquarius;"A personal interpretation of this planet position can be obtained by consulting the house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. The generation with Uranus in Aquarius is today, 1999, between 78 and 85 years old.



In the year 1996, Uranus returned to Aquarius, the sign it rules. Many Astrologers recognize this as the beginning of the Age of Aquarius, the age following the one of Pisces. The central figure of the past age was Jesus Christ, whose sensitivity was unique and who, if the common traditions can be believed, practiced a kind of brotherly love that we unfortunately could not live within our societal contexts in the past 2000 years. Uranus in Aquarius will make us abruptly aware that the destruction of our living space has already progressed to an advanced stage, in which nothing short of a global brotherhood and sisterhood will give us hope of saving at least parts of it. The positive side of the development is that more people understand that the unrestrained exploitation of our Mother Earth is making a few people very wealthy while deteriorating the general quality of life.



If Uranus receives negative aspects, you may tend to obstinacy and impracticable ideas while shying away from responsibility."
492;RADIX_0000000000180673;Your Uranus in Pisces;"A personal interpretation of this planet position can be obtained by consulting the house position and its aspects to other planets in the chart. The generation with Uranus in Pisces is today, 1999, between 71 and 79 years old and will be enjoying their well-deserved retirement.



People with this constellation have the general ability to comprehend the facts both intuitively as well as rationally. At this level, at the time of your birth was the wild 20's, in which the people generally lacked restraint and in the field of music, temperamental styles became popular. People wanted to get away from out-of-date traditions to give individual personality more expression. The connection to the spirit became important again.



If Uranus receives challenging aspects, it may be difficult for you to accept reality and live in the here and now."
493;RADIX_0000000002097602;Your Uranus in Conjunction with Your Neptune;"This conjunction has been in the sign Capricorn since 1989 and based on an orb of eight degrees, it lasted until 1997. During this time, we observed that one of the dominant political systems simply was not able to live up to expectations and has more or less disappeared from the scene, without being able to cover up the destruction of the environment or human rights abuses they left behind. Although there are many aspects of democracy that should be discussed further, and the last word certainly has not been spoken, still it has been shown that this system is more stable than communism, which was primarily characterized by inhumanity.



Capricorn is the sign of politics and reason. Uranus, which has a tendency to suddenly break into action and Neptune who reveals illusions, have made it hard for politicians to feed the masses empty promises. This has caused political disaffection to take hold, which could become dangerous when moderates stop participating in elections and enable fanatical splinter groups to establish themselves in society.



Generally, a period of elemental spiritual and intellectual progress for all of humanity is due. With this aspect in your horoscope, you should belong to a new group of souls capable of bringing forth humanitarian ideas appropriate to our time and in support of the development of mankind. It will take a couple of years until these people develop their potential."
494;RADIX_0000000002359746;Your Uranus in Conjunction with Your Pluto;"This aspect is found in the charts of people born between 1962 and 1968. Because the Uranus-Pluto conjunction was in Virgo, the discoveries of this time are associated with this sign. There was research into ways of preserving and packaging foods. Since then it has become clear that many of these achievements have done more harm than good. The environment is being exploited more and more and the heritage we leave to our children becomes more and more polluted. 



This aspect in your chart makes you rebellious; you could make the deactivation of social mechanisms that you consider to be outdated your life's work. If you should happen to know what life is all about, you could develop ideas that change living conditions for the better.



Being in a position to understand the fixed rules governing the development of mankind, you are also aware that these rules are necessary to implement needed changes. Be careful that your lack of discipline does not lead you to misuse your influence for the satisfaction of your own egotistical desires."
495;RADIX_0000000008389058;Your Uranus in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;"You are an adventurer and are ready for anything, as long as it is new. This leads you to constant discoveries of various sides of yourself, which promote your personal development. An unconventional lifestyle, which you should maintain, distinguishes you from the masses because it will eventually lead you to the achievement of your ambitions. Sometimes sudden changes transform your life, but you usually tend to adapt to new situation, well because you are extremely flexible.



You are a freedom-loving person and are conscious of your own independence. Still, you need a lot of contact and a large circle of friends in order to feel at home. Be careful that a lack of concentration does not cause you to have accidents."
496;RADIX_0000000009175490;Your Uranus in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"Expressing your individuality is important to you. Recognition from others is assured, even if some people are intimidated by you. Take care not to become too arrogant. This is probably a trap that you are well aware of.



Love of the unusual has made you well known for your spontaneity, which is often contagious and arouses enthusiasm in others. Because the planet Uranus is also involved in structuring the future, you actively and intensively participate in its structuring, whereby you are mostly concerned with developing new concepts of individual freedom.



Your intuitive talents should be put to use; it may be enjoyable for you to learn more about Astrology or a similar field."
497;RADIX_0000000009437634;Your Uranus in Conjunction with Your MC;"Uranus at MC indicates that not only your career but also your general orientation are unconventional. Maybe your eccentric behavior brings a little excitement to work or maybe you have even won prizes for your suggestions for improvements. Because Uranus stands for every kind of new technology, this conjunction may imply an interest in research of the natural sciences.



On the other hand, Uranus is also concerned with freedom, this will make the restrictions at work seem painful. If you have a general tendency to rebel against authorities then you should get started building up your own business, so that you can work independently."
498;RADIX_0000000008405442;Your Uranus in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;An overpowering longing for freedom and independence makes it difficult for you to get involved in real relationships. Although you have unusual talents, still you tend to charge into your activities and have to accept failures. New undertakings often distract you and often run a similar course. Become more patient and work for compromises even if they come at the cost of your individuality. Listen to the suggestions and the criticism of others or you will find yourself alone some day. It is important for you to learn to carry responsibility and to make long-term plans. If you do not, unforeseen events, such as an accident, could force you to change the course of your life.
499;RADIX_0000000009191874;Your Uranus in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"Expressing your individuality is important to you. If anyone touches your independence you defend yourself with tooth and nail, or are insulted. Conventional relations to the opposite sex are not for you. You need to come and go any time you want.



As a passionate revolutionary, you had plenty of conflicts with your parents and teachers and may have left your parent's house at an early age. Take care not to become too arrogant, although this is probably a trap which you are well aware of.



Out of love of the unusual you are known for your spontaneity, which often makes it difficult for you to reach an agreement with others. Because the planet Uranus is also involved in structuring the future, you actively and intensively participate on its structuring, whereby you are mostly concerned with fighting against social injustice."
500;RADIX_0000000009454018;Your Uranus in Opposition with Your MC;"You have difficulties adapting to the current situation. Whether at work or at home, you stand in opposition to your parents or your boss and have earned yourself a reputation for being a minor revolutionary. Possibly it could go so far as to drive you from one place to another, without there being any evident cause.



Responsibility in the family has always been a source of conflict between you and your parents. Even if you do not value compromises, you should try to give in once in a while."
501;RADIX_0000000002130370;Your Uranus in Square with Your Neptune;"This square is found in the charts of people who were born in the 50's and grew up in times of unusual social turmoil. During this time, means of communication and transportation were developed and the world became smaller; mankind was impressed by the first films from the Earth's crisis centers. Also, the first commercial non-stop transatlantic jet powered flight was accomplished and the first monkey was launched into space.



Personally, you could be inclined to violent temper tantrums, wild escapades, hectic reactions and have a shaky outlook on life. Although you can be extremely idealistic, it takes on a form that is sometimes difficult for others to follow. This may cause conflicts and chaotic situations which you will be forced to deal with."
502;RADIX_0000000002392514;Your Uranus in Square with Your Pluto;"This aspect existed between 1930 and 1935, as humanity was subjected to grievous transformations. At this time there was a great economic crisis and people were busy trying to find some way of getting something to eat. Regular work was hardly imaginable. In Germany, the time was ripe for Adolf Hitler. He brought relative ""order"" to the existing chaos, but the price for his followers was very high, which none of us are likely to forget very soon, even if we were not alive at the time.



In your individual birth chart, this aspect is made valid by your efforts to change the existing social circumstances. Your motives may contain aspects that have to be taken seriously, because you are an honest person. Still, you may have had to deal with difficult circumstances since the beginning of your life, which may hinder you in your enjoyment of material pleasures. You should not make yourself a martyr."
503;RADIX_0000000008421826;Your Uranus in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;Learn not to charge into things, but to be patient and take time to plan. Become more aware of the time it takes to implement changes, not everything can change overnight. Sometimes you take high risks and wonder why things do not work out. Learn to control yourself and your mood swings. It would be very helpful if you did not let your hectic state create confusion. Maybe you would be able to avoid some of the accidents that might occur. Events which suddenly arise force you to reconsider your life and maybe to draw consequences out of failures.
504;RADIX_0000000009208258;Your Uranus in Square with Your Ascendant;"Expressing your individuality is important to you. If anyone should try to take away your independence, you defend yourself with tooth and nail, or are insulted. As a passionate revolutionary, you had plenty of conflicts with your parents and teachers and are well known for always having your own way of doing things. Take care not to become too arrogant, although this is probably a trap which you are well aware of.



Out of love of the unusual you are known for your spontaneity, which is often contagious and arouses enthusiasm in others. Because the planet Uranus is also involved in structuring the future, you actively and intensively participate in its structuring, whereby you are mostly concerned with fighting against social injustice."
505;RADIX_0000000009470402;Your Uranus in Square with Your MC;"You have difficulties adapting to the current situation. Whether at work or at home, you stand in opposition to your parents or your boss and have earned yourself a reputation for being a minor revolutionary. Possibly it could go so far as to drive you from one place to another, without there being any evident cause.



Responsibility within the family has always been a source of conflict between you and your parents. Even if you do not value compromises, you should try to give in once in a while."
506;RADIX_0000000002146754;Your Uranus in Trine with Your Neptune;"This aspect hits the generation born between 1938 and 1945. During this time, a sort of mass hysteria broke out, which was initiated by individual despots. Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and the Emperor of Japan, Hirohito, were in a position to exercise a hypnotic influence on masses of people, which finally brought about the death of many people and left destructive scars on the world.



On a personal level, you can work against a repetition of history by denying your support to politicians who do not earn your trust. You should look behind the scenes and be able to sense injustice. But that alone is not enough, it is also your responsibility to place what you have learned at everyone's disposal. Possibly you have utopian ideals or want to encourage the spiritual development of mankind."
507;RADIX_0000000002408898;Your Uranus in Trine with Your Pluto;"You were born at a lively time: the ""golden twenties"". The world gave into wonderful illusions and no one noticed that a worldwide economic crisis was threatening. A completely new kind of perception was initiated; however, it would take some time before it could be implemented. C.G. Jung published his works about the individual and the collective subconscious. He laid the foundation for the later comprehension of human motivation, even if we still are not able to completely understand it.



Possibly you sacrifice yourself willingly in favor of the progress and further development of humanity. You enjoy supporting the new tendencies and wish deeper societal renewal when the old structures no longer offer room for self-fulfillment."
508;RADIX_0000000008438210;Your Uranus in Trine with Your Northern Moon Node;This is an exciting aspect, which is always providing you with new ideas. There are alternatives to following the herd and you often make your own way, especially when you are convinced that you are right. Outdated structures should be renewed, in your opinion, whereby you do not go about it rashly. Freedom is precious to you and you try to enjoy it as long as possible, so you avoid committing yourself to anything too quickly. Sometimes the courses of things deal you an extra joker and you usually know how to make use of it. A large circle of friends leaves you with no complaints about lack of contacts. If you continue to follow your intuition, nothing more can go wrong.
509;RADIX_0000000009224642;Your Uranus in Trine with Your Ascendant;"Expressing your individuality is exceedingly important to you. The respect of others is assured because of your unorthodox conduct and originality, which you use to explore every variety of the truth. This brings you into contact with people in a highly unconventional manner. With your pronounced spontaneity and love of freedom you should look for a profession which allows you to work independently.



Because the planet Uranus is concerned with the future, you actively and intensively participate in its development, whereby you are primarily concerned with the research and development of concepts for individual freedom.



Strong intuition as well as your creative potential should be put to use in disciplined activity. Maybe you would enjoy learning more about Astrology or some similar field, which would bring you closer to the freedom and truth you are striving to attain."
510;RADIX_0000000009486786;Your Uranus in Trine with Your MC;"This aspect indicates that not only your career but also your general orientation are unconventional. Maybe your eccentric behavior brings a little excitement to work or maybe you have even won prizes for your suggestions for improvements. Individuality is one area where you are not willing to compromise, and that is exactly what gives rise to your prestige.



Because Uranus stands for all new developments in technology, this trine could indicate an interest in research into the natural sciences.



Also your relationship to your parents may be unusual. Possibly, one of your parents was very eccentric and always impressed you, so much so that it had a tremendous impact on your life."
511;RADIX_0000000002163138;Your Uranus in Sextile with Your Neptune;"This sextile is found in the charts of people who were born between 1964 and 1968. This conjunction can only be seen in connection with the simultaneous Pluto-Uranus conjunction, whereby Pluto stands at a sextile to Neptune in your chart. Because the Uranus-Pluto conjunction has come about in the sign Virgo, and builds a sextile to Neptune in Scorpio, some discoveries associated with Virgo were made during this time. A process for preserving food was discovered as well as new forms of packaging. It has since become clear that some of these achievements have done more harm than good.



Also, a kind of uprising among the youth emerged during this time; in America, for the first time, people were unwilling to send their sons 7000 miles to a foreign, inhospitable country, to lose life and limb.



With this sextile, you should be able to develop an intellectual consciousness and under certain conditions realize a lifestyle which seemed to be unrealistic. A good example of this is rock music, represented by the legendary open-air festival in Woodstock at the end of the 60's. Although the long-haired musicians, which some found to be noisemakers, were initially sneered at, many of them became millionaires, even if their sometimes fatal way of life did not exactly meet with the approval of the masses."
512;RADIX_0000000002425282;Your Uranus in Sextile with Your Pluto;"This aspect existed from 1941 until 1946. In this period, there was a war to be won and every side tried to justify the horrendous number of victims. At the same time, not only the weapons industry made a lot profits, but also opportunists had unrestrained possibilities in the private economy.



On an individual level, your intuitive perception could enable you to go into scientific research. You understand the intrinsic structures of the natural powers and wish to change the predominant social circumstances and initiate constructive improvements in your environment. In active pursuit of higher learning you try to deepen your intuitive insights."
513;RADIX_0000000008454594;Your Uranus in Sextile with Your Northern Moon Node;This is an exciting aspect, which is always providing you with new ideas. There are alternatives to following the herd and you often make your own way, especially when you are convinced that you are right.

If you continue to follow your intuition, nothing more can go wrong.
514;RADIX_0000000009241026;Your Uranus in Sextile with Your Ascendant;"Expressing your individuality is important to you. Recognition from others is assured, because of your unorthodox conduct and originality, although some people feel offended. As long as those people remain the exception, you should be able to win the cooperation of the others around you.



With your pronounced spontaneity and love of freedom you should look for a profession which allows you to work independently. Because the planet Uranus is also concerned with structuring the future, you will be actively and intensively involved in its development, whereby you will primarily be involved in researching and developing concepts for individual freedom.



Put your intuition to use, possibly you would enjoy learning more about Astrology or some related field."
515;RADIX_0000000009503170;Your Uranus in Sextile with Your MC;"This aspect indicates that not only your career but also your general orientation are unconventional. Maybe your eccentric behavior brings a little excitement to work or maybe you have even won prizes for your suggestions for improvements. Individuality is one area where you are not willing to compromise, and that is exactly what gives rise to your prestige.



Uranus stands for everything which has to do with technology, this is why this sextile can lead you to the area of research in the natural sciences. Also the relationship to your parents may be very unusual. Possibly, one of your parents was very eccentric and always impressed you, so much so that it had a tremendous impact on your life."
516;RADIX_0000000000000454;Your Uranus in the First House;"Doing almost everything differently than everyone else has become your trademark. You always seem to be on the go and are constantly thinking up crazy new ideas. How many of them are put into practice is another question; which does not have anything to do with Uranus in the first house. Being very unconventional and always conspicuous, traditional ties like marriage and family do not especially attract you. It would be best if you were allowed to find your own way and not have to suppress your individuality. The technical fields are where your greatest talents lie. Because Uranus is associated with electricity, you will also be able to repair an iron. Sometimes you are not able to see lurking dangers. Some people can be hurt due to your fear of responsibility. Despite this, you have high ideals and run onto the battlefield with flags flying under the motto, ""freedom, equality and brotherhood"". Your ideas concerning cohabitation should be decidedly modern and you have mostly good intentions. If you manage to give in to some situations without providing commentary, you should have no social problems."
517;RADIX_0000000000016838;Your Uranus in the Second House;"You have a special capacity to adapt to new situations quickly and know how to get by in difficult times. You make creative use of your material resources and are often lucky. Possibly your financial situation is constantly changing. Some day you may be forced to start all over again from scratch, but you will manage it somehow. You love speculation and are not averse to the game, which is why you should consider carefully how far you want to go in this respect.



You can sense financial developments and come up with original strategies to use your knowledge to your advantage. In the second house, Uranus is not dependent on its possessions but appreciates the possibilities for experimentation, which are certain to open."
518;RADIX_0000000000033222;Your Uranus in the Third House;"You are original and have your own way of thinking. As is to be expected, this tends to cause misunderstandings, especially with people who do not have a feeling for creative language and who tend to express themselves conventionally. You, however, love to create your own words and think up imaginative formulations. Probably you would be a good journalist and be very successful in media.



You perceive the world with your own eyes and do not want to let anyone dictate how you should see things. You approach new areas naively and are able to discover aspects that are overlooked by people with fixed conceptions. Your curiosity is as large as your love of freedom. Quickly and intuitively, your sharp powers of reason find the answer to important questions. The only thing missing is stamina.



You should try to get your nerves under control. If problems with your brothers and sisters should come up, you patiently look for an answer and listen attentively to what is said to you."
519;RADIX_0000000000049606;Your Uranus in the Fourth House;"Probably the search for your roots or for a real home has worn you out for a long time. Stability was not something your family could offer; you may have had to move often as a child. Your outlook on life was formed independently of the values of your family. Even if your first actual flight out of the nest was not your idea, you still wanted to be independent from early on. Because you were different, you did not feel accepted and have had to pay for this with a restless nature. It is to be hoped that you will one day find a place where you can settle down with people you love. Hopefully, you will not make the mistake of letting your fear of attachments cause you to pack up and move on suddenly, continuing your search.



Maybe your mother was not able to offer you the security you needed as a child and was often not there. That explains why you do not even want to be available for your own family and frequently present with decisions that you made without consulting them."
520;RADIX_0000000000065990;Your Uranus in the Fifth House;"You have an original way of expressing yourself and you put all your determination into it. With your creative ability you astound everyone because you are ahead of your time and make use of your unusual way of expressing yourself. Do not let anyone convince you to take on a more conventional style, continue your pioneering efforts because this is your talent.



You have an unusual love life, you are not the type for long relationships because you get bored quickly and valiantly defend your precious freedom. You are easily impressed by new acquaintances. Ask yourself if the warmth and familiarity that comes from living according to your whims is enough for you.



If you have kids, although you will avoid this responsibility for a long time, you should be able to build up a good relationship with them. You will raise your kids progressively and give them a lot of your liberal attitudes on the way."
521;RADIX_0000000000082374;Your Uranus in the Sixth House;"You put a lot of thought into your work and want to be constantly challenged. Humanitarian ideals are what you enjoy working towards the most, although you do not like to work on one thing very long. You do not work out of a pure sense of responsibility to your employer, but really want to commit yourself. Once you have taken on something, you will make a lot of suggestions that will bring about a lot of improvements. Use your flexible intellect to come up with ideas to help people. When inspired to be active, you could serve as an example for finding fulfillment in your profession.



If the aspects to Uranus are difficult, you could quit your job often because your expectations are too idealistic. Possibly your colleagues complain about your flightiness and have difficulties with your eccentric nature. Maybe you overload yourself until your health suffers. The sixth house stands for our relation to our body. You should be sensitive to your body's signals and take its needs seriously.



You are interested in all the new technological developments and should be adept at working in research because you devote yourself to tasks without preconceived notions."
522;RADIX_0000000000098758;Your Uranus in the Seventh House;"You are looking for an unusual relationship, which will inspire you and shoud not restrict you. Honesty and creativity are the most important factors. Boredom is not easy for you to stand. This may result in a string of short-lived romances. You may suddenly meet someone who transforms your consciousness from one day to the next and insists on marrying, only to get divorced after six months.



Your role in society will go beyond the traditional social circles. You will always be full of surprises, have an unconventional way with people and probably have a talent for diplomacy, even if people sometimes find you taxing.



Possibly you will find yourself in a dilemma, if other factors of your horoscope point to a need for security and closeness. Then you should look for a partner who will not restrict your development and can still get involved with you. Activities outside your relationship will always be important to you."
523;RADIX_0000000000115142;Your Uranus in the Eighth House;"Probably challenging situations will awaken a sudden burst of new energy, which will surprise even you. Often you have sudden realizations that help you out of a traumatic emotional state. You take on new projects spontaneously and enthusiastically and are always trying to overcome your limitations. You have a bold approach to work, especially if it is for peaceful coexistence. You could have an extreme sex life because you are insatiably curious about sex and do not want to miss out on a single experience. In bed you love to experiment and probably have a pretty good idea about how an ideal relationship should be.



With all your strength you try to control your emotions, especially anger, hate and jealousy. It is the psychological aspects of Astrology and similar fields which interest you the most. Medicine also arouses your curiosity. Not only your life but also your convictions may be transformed by unanticipated turns that could even result in situations where large sums of money play a role."
524;RADIX_0000000000131526;Your Uranus in the Ninth House;"You have unusual ideas about religion and justice and their role in the formation of communities. You construct your outlook on life, which can change suddenly if you find a more complete theoretical approach. You are constantly hunting for new intellectual insights and endeavor to convince people to think more progressively. Orthodox belief systems and strict moral codes provoke you in such a manner that you never miss an opportunity to take a stand against them. Furthering intellectual freedom for all of humanity is your goal.



In your opinion, even the system of education should be reformed such that humanitarian ideals could be taught to everyone at an early age. The technology and diverse electronic media interest you, as do new means of transportation. That the world is continually getting smaller is a welcome development from your perspective. This brings increased possibilities to move on to a new location.



Possibly you are a fan of science fiction novels. Active participation in the structuring of future civilization would interest you, whereby you would prefer to play an intellectual role."
525;RADIX_0000000000147910;Your Uranus in the Tenth House;"If anyone gave you a chance, you would revolutionize society. You have very progressive ideas about nations and politics that can be called radical. If developments do not continue to progress and the same conservative powers retain control, you are dissatisfied. Professionally, you stand for high ideals and look for a position that allows you to work toward these goals. Possibly you change jobs frequently because you believe that you still have not found the right place and are wasting your energies. Perhaps you have to become a little more patient in this respect and accept the fact that you are not going to be made the Secretary General of the United Nations in the foreseeable future.



In any case, you are well-suited for occupations which are not intellectually restricting and where you can experiment to your heart's content. It is very probable that you have a highly unusual profession or that you work in modern technology. Most probably, the influence of your father on your way of thinking was strong. He was certainly an eccentric and possibly he brought restlessness into your childhood."
526;RADIX_0000000000164294;Your Uranus in the Eleventh House;"In the eleventh house Uranus is at home, which intensifies its qualities. You represent high ideals in friendships that are not always very realistic. Your energy is set on finding people with similar convictions to band together for activities. Chances are that you stand for humanitarian and progressive ideas spirited by a powerful will to reform. For others, you could serve as a source of inspiration, when it comes to structuring a peaceful co-existence of everyone on the planet. You feel tied to all of humanity and will never give up hope, probably because you know how much people can achieve once they are united, if the will and conviction are there.



If Uranus' aspects are difficult, it could be that you find yourself in a dilemma: you want to contribute your energy to serving a greater cause within an organization, but at the same time, you are afraid of sacrificing your identity and getting lost in the crowd. It may cause difficulties that you insist on realizing your own ideas and are not willing to listen to others.



However, it should be possible for you to find a constructive solution to these problems in order to get your ideals out to more people."
527;RADIX_0000000000180678;Your Uranus in the Twelfth House;"It is certainly not always easy for you to understand your motivations, especially since they can change suddenly. Sometimes a vague foreboding descends upon you, which turns out to be true. Also, sudden transformations in your life may be on the agenda.



Take a trip through your subconsciousness and learn from your complete subliminal experiences in order to acquire the ability to recognize the necessary structures for reforms of this foundation. Your spiritual life is diverse and your most beautiful talent could be helping others out by offering unconventional ideas and intuitive understanding.



If the aspects to Uranus are difficult, there is a danger of your thoughts and feelings getting off track and becoming inconsistent. It is most certainly possible that you could develop insecurities and phobias because you fear complexities but do not want to risk becoming isolated. If you want to solve this problem, you are going to have to dig deep.



Your inclination to spiritual ideas and religious thought can lead you to sects or occult groups. You may even succeed in giving new meaning to the terms mercy and brotherly love."
528;RADIX_0000000000000516;Neptune - The Cosmic Consciousness;"An astronomer in Berlin who noticed that Uranus often deviated from its orbit first discovered Neptune in the year 1946. The cause had to be an unknown planet, which was then called Neptune. Neptune orbits the Sun every 165 years and has a diameter of 47,000 kilometers. It is invisible to the naked eye.



In Mythology, Neptune or Poseidon is the god of the sea and lord of the water, which is the element that forms the basis of all life. The depth of the sea often distorts vision creating the illusion of a surrealistic world. In Astrology Neptune represents deception, mysticism, imagination, dreams, extrasensory capabilities, a foreboding and inspiration. It symbolizes creative energy. With Neptune's help creative abilities can find expression. Neptune stays in one sign for 14 years, therefore its individual interpretation, house position and aspects of other planets should be considered. Neptune is assigned to the sign Pisces."
529;RADIX_0000000000066049;Your Neptune in Leo;"In order to interpret this planet position for yourself you should consult its house position as well as its aspects to other planets. Neptune was in the sign Leo from 1915 until 1929, so that its generation today, 1999, is between 69 and 84 years old. They actively experienced the Second World War and have most probably made some grievous experiences with abusive human existence on the brink of ruin.



This constellation stands for creativity and imagination, but also for exaggerated stubbornness, self-deception and conceit. This caused the careless speculation and risky investments leading to the stock market crash and the resulting economic crises. Many people paid a high price for arrogantly overestimating themselves. In Germany, the Weimar Republic was founded without a realistic understanding of its actual role."
530;RADIX_0000000000082433;Your Neptune in Virgo;"In order to interpret this planet position for yourself, you should consult its house position as well as its aspects to other planets. Neptune was in the sign Virgo from 1928 until 1943. Its generation today, 1999, is between 56 and 70 years old. You survived the Second World War and probably have endured some rather extreme experiences.



You had a hard time expressing your creativity and imagination in an artistic manner. After the war, it was necessary to concentrate on fundamental needs. This could have left you with a tendency to defy material possessions and with a weakness for garish cuteness. You probably think practically and set your ambitions towards gradually but steadily improving your standard of living. Hopefully, you are not deceiving yourself in this respect and remember the importance of carefully considering what it is you are spending so much time working for."
531;RADIX_0000000000098817;Your Neptune in Libra;"In order to interpret this planet position for yourself you should consult its house position as well as its aspects to the other planets. Neptune was in Libra from about 1943 until 1956. Its generation is today, 1999, between 43 and 56 years old.



As part of the generation following the world war, you experienced much confusion in human relationships, especially in romantic relationships. Women started fighting for their rights, demanding equality, which initially caused some turbulence but eventually led to a more positive self-image. It was a time of insecurity, because no one knew exactly how to behave in a family or partnership. This generation had a different concept of peace and harmony, which placed a vast gap between them and their parents. Woodstock brought lots of people together with Neptune in Libra. ""Peace, Love and Music"" was the message for one hundred thousand young people who came together in the pouring rain, in an unprecedented manner."
532;RADIX_0000000000115201;Your Neptune in Scorpio;"In order to interpret this planet position for yourself you should consult its house position as well as its aspects to the other planets. Neptune remained in Scorpio from 1955 to 1970; its generation today in 1999 is approximately 29 to 44 years old.



At the time of your birth, the society fundamentally changed its attitude toward sexuality. The exploitation of eroticism and sex in advertising as well as in other economic contexts was initiated. A monogamously lifestyle was no longer taken for granted. Electrically produced music has found its niche; many of its artists are getting their views across to their masses of fans. Often they have thought up new visions of peaceful coexistence, which people who have not yet developed to this stage unfortunately are not capable of understanding. Members of this generation will have recognized that our planet has got to be regenerated ecologically and socially and that one day we have got to find suitable measures to restore the balance of our living space."
533;RADIX_0000000000131585;Your Neptune in Sagittarius;"In order to interpret this planet position for yourself you should consult its house position as well as its aspects to other planets. Neptune resided in Sagittarius from 1970 until 1984. Its generation is today, in the year 1999, between 15 and 29 years old. 



At the time of your birth, the tourism industry began to boom. Long trips were within almost everyone's reach and the world was rapidly getting smaller. Contact to people in foreign lands was made possible, even though many people today still do not take advantage of the opportunity to broaden their horizons. Far Eastern philosophy made its entry into people's minds and enjoyed more popularity. At the same time, dubious cults or sects came into existence that held their victims captive.



Your generation will increasingly integrate fields like Astrology into their lives. You have understood that it provides a context for people to envision themselves within larger relationships. It is possible that this will lead to an increased respect for our environment."
534;RADIX_0000000000147969;Your Neptune in Capricorn;"In order to interpret this planet position for yourself, you should consult its house position as well as its aspects to other planets. Neptune has been in the sign Capricorn since 1984 and is planning to stay there until the year 2000. This generation is today, 1999, at the most 16 years old.



Since 1984, the many changes in the area of politics have been causing confusion. The conjunction Neptune entered with Uranus must be mentioned in this connotation because it produces the element of spontaneity. To the world's amazement, the communist system was practically dissolved overnight, as the people recognized that the functionaries had been deceiving them.



Once this state of consciousness has been attained, taking the next step to ecological responsibility is inevitable. Obviously, the inclusion of concrete measures, certain to aid the healing process of our environment must follow, since Capricorn is the sign of social responsibility. Because nationalism inhibits progress, international organizations such as the UN, are gaining in importance. The dawning of the Age of Aquarius must be prepared now."
535;RADIX_0000000008389122;Your Neptune in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;"You are very sensitive and feel like you are headed in the right direction. Being friendly, open and generous ensures your popularity, although it can take a long time before you make intimate revelations about yourself. A fulfilled spiritual life does not let you take life lightly. Your dedication to people in need of your help is rewarded with much love. Your dreams are very important to you, because they tell you if your life is in accord with your soul. Explore your musical talents and try to learn an instrument; that could mean a lot to you. If you can overcome your vulnerability and approach life confidently, you will achieve everything that your imagination will allow you to dream up."
536;RADIX_0000000009175554;Your Neptune in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"With your sensibility you probably have supernatural abilities which you may not be aware of. Being in a position to look behind the scenes, you are unsettled by what you see there. This may cause you to doubt yourself, although the circumstances that you perceive do not have anything to do with you.



On the other hand, you may have a magical attraction that draws other people, which can go so far as to have a hypnotic effect. Still, you are careful not to misuse your influence for egotistical purposes. That could have fatal consequences. Probably you know that the Earth can be peaceful and a healthy place to live and you should use your energies to bring about this transformation, even if your perception of reality is sometimes clouded."
537;RADIX_0000000009437698;Your Neptune in Conjunction with Your MC;If you are not able to practice a profession that incorporates your creativity and imagination, you will not be especially successful. Because of your lack of discipline and energy you could be your boss' nightmare. Probably you are most at home in the arts, if you should be able to get your own business going you will be completely satisfied. Esoteric fields could arouse your curiosity and with your sense of perception, you should definitely give in to the impulse. However, you betray a certain instability, and should therefore be careful of excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs.
538;RADIX_0000000008405506;Your Neptune in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;"You notice that your life is not getting anywhere and maybe you even take drugs to escape from it all. You have only vague ideas about the future, which is why it is difficult for you to get your life together. Maybe you think you do not have enough energy and stamina to take on useful goals. A deep lack of security and confused emotions prevent you from looking reality in the eye and from letting go of the past. Maybe you set extremely high ideals and beneath a certain level are not willing to leave your dream world and become concrete.



Even if you struggle against it, you are going to have to take on responsibility and realize that no one but you can fill your life with purpose."
539;RADIX_0000000009191938;Your Neptune in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"With your sensitivity, you may overreact expecially to criticism. Moreover, you may be strongly influenced by the people around you, whereby you could be in danger of not being able to differentiate between good and evil, which can lead to your being used by others. It could do you good to learn to say no once in a while. Avoid escaping into your own little dream world, this will only veil your perception of reality.



Although you have a very active imagination and often wish that you had made use of the opportunity to voice your thoughts, you have been holding yourself back all your life. For this reason, you should think about going into a field concerned with the needs of many people, because you are especially receptive to unjust social circumstances. This will also earn you the recognition of others."
540;RADIX_0000000009454082;Your Neptune in Opposition with Your MC;"A professional life marked by disappointments could be related to your lack of discipline that keeps you from leading an orderly life. The chaos at home may be the result of a lack of orientation in your youth and during your childhood. Do not get too involved in drugs or you may distort your perception of reality.



Neptune stands for the negative aspects of illusion and self-delusion, while the MC represents social standing. This aspect indicates that this area may be characterized by confusion. You should make an effort to see things realistically, whereby it would be good if you kept one honest person around who you can count on."
541;RADIX_0000000008421890;Your Neptune in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;"This aspect can express itself in a variety of ways. Possibly you are afraid of looking inside yourself and discovering something new. You avoid emotions and dreams and do not want to be reminded of the fact that there are dimensions other than the material world, which is your favorite escape. You make little use of your imagination because you want to stay on the ground. If you do not change your attitude about your inner workings and if you remain closed to the spiritual world, you will be forced to recognize one day how empty and boring your life has become.



Maybe you live at the other extreme and never want to take off your rose-colored glasses. You do not feel ready for reality and are afraid to take the crucial steps that would change your life. In this case you will have to analyze your conduct meticulously and come into contact with the outside world. Without a confrontation there will be no further development for you."
542;RADIX_0000000009208322;Your Neptune in Square with Your Ascendant;"With your sensitivity you may overreact especially to criticism. Thereby you could feel used by the people around you; saying ""no"" is not exactly one of your strengths. You have a tendency to withdraw into a dream world. As a child your parents may have criticized you for this and used the opportunity to express their general dissatisfaction with you.



This has encouraged you to feel comfortable with holding yourself back, although you actually have a very active imagination and often feel that you could have said more. Maybe you should go into a profession concerned with the needs of many people; you are especially receptive to concepts concerning social injustice. This will enable you to earn the recognition of others."
543;RADIX_0000000009470466;Your Neptune in Square with Your MC;"A professional life marked by disappointments could be related to your lack of discipline that keeps you from leading an orderly life.

544;RADIX_0000000008438274;Your Neptune in Trine with Your Northern Moon Node;"This is a beautiful aspect, which will give you the sensitivity to build deep relationships. By staying in contact with your soul and your dreams, you manage life on a daily basis. Your interest for music, poetry and mysticism brings you to think critically about your life but especially about your role in it. A need for harmonious surroundings will prevent you from striving to fulfill your needs at the cost of others. A sense of romance and the tender side of life provide wonderful hours of enjoyment; once you have gained trust you have no problem opening yourself and surrendering to it. The ability to master the tight rope act between taking in and warding off should make you successful."
545;RADIX_0000000009224706;Your Neptune in Trine with Your Ascendant;"With your sensibility you probably have supernatural abilities which you may not be aware of. Being in a position to look behind the scenes, you are unsettled by what you see there. However, you will not blame yourself but do your best to transform the situation positively.



On the other hand, you may have a magical attraction that draws other people and might go so far as to have a hypnotic effect on people. Probably the danger of abuse of these powers for your own egotistical purposes is relatively small. Probably you know that the Earth can be peaceful and a healthy place to live and you should use your energies to bring about this transformation. This could be emotionally beneficial and earn you the acknowledgment that you have always hoped for."
546;RADIX_0000000009486850;Your Neptune in Trine with Your MC;This aspect puts you in a position to recognize the hidden connections underlying the basis of human interaction. In addition, you have the ability to intuitively grasp the mood of the people around you. Professionally, you are probably involved with the arts, and with your creative potential, success should not be out of your reach. The atmosphere at home grows out of sensitivity and your relationships with everyone are characterized by warmth.
547;RADIX_0000000002425346;Your Neptune in Sextile with Your Pluto;"This aspect has been around since about 1943 and will live a long time yet, especially in the current era where Pluto has gotten into an irregular orbit. Therefore, this aspect should be interpreted according to its consequences for the entire world, as opposed to its influence on individuals. With this aspect, mankind should be enabled to achieve spiritual progress, which may reach its climax in due course since Neptune resides in Aquarius. At the end of the eighties, one of the two dominating political systems practically disappeared. The charts of the generations that caused this contained a sextile between Neptune and Pluto.



It was not by chance that this aspect came into being during a critical period of mankind's development. Some people would have us believe that the atomic age would introduce mankind into an ideal world of prosperity and contentment. What was not mentioned was that the potential for destroying the planet Earth several times over was hidden within it. Twenty years ago, people were saying that unbelievable plutonic powers, which were developed by misguided, ingenious scientists, could be used creatively without causing any danger. Today, everyone who is earning a living in the atomic energy industry has no doubt about the potential for disaster which human and technological failures can cause. A look at useful regenerating sources of energy such as hemp, sadly the production of which has encountered strong resistance, reveals that it is high time to place the decisions concerning the well-being of this planet in the hands of people whose vision extends beyond the next election.



Maybe it is time for younger people to take the fate of the planet in their own hands, because they have a future ahead of them and approach planning and structuring with more sensitivity than our older, elected representatives are capable of.



Today, it is more important than ever to let the universal love, represented by Neptune, come to its full expression. This reality and its tragic necessity became a little more clear during the world climatic conferences which took place in Berlin and Rio, where certain island states expressed concern about the rising sea level and who are given no opportunity to do anything about it. Also when we look at the ozone paradox - too much above, too little below - we get an impression of mankind's challenge for the future. A lot depends on how intensively we understand that our normal life span of 70-75 years is nothing in comparison to the time span of the development of the world. Hopefully, one day we will be able to internalize the fact that man is only one small gear in the mechanism of the universe, even if he can think; a fact that may be a tragic element."
548;RADIX_0000000008454658;Your Neptune in Sextile with Your Northern Moon Node;"This is a beautiful aspect, which will give you the sensitivity to build deep relationships. By staying in contact with your soul and your dreams you manage life on a daily basis. Your interests for music, poetry and mysticism bring you to think critically about your life but especially about your role in it.

The ability to master the tight rope act between taking in and warding off should make you successful."
549;RADIX_0000000009241090;Your Neptune in Sextile with Your Ascendant;"Your sensibility allows you to show deep emotions. Because you can be very charming, you are in a position to capture people's fascination and convince them that what you are working on is worthwhile. If your goals are not egotistical, this could have a positive effect. If you tend to be self-centered, this could have consequences that will be unpleasant for you.



On the other hand, you may have a magical attraction that draws other people, which can go so far as to have a hypnotic effect. Also, here it is vital that it is used for the benefit of everyone. If you are able to learn to be more decisive, your self-confidence will grow and you will be able to devote yourself to higher ambitions."
550;RADIX_0000000009503234;Your Neptune in Sextile with Your MC;"This aspect puts you in a position to recognize the hidden connections underlying the basis of human interaction. In addition, you have the ability to intuitively grasp the mood of the people around you. Professionally, you are probably involved with the arts, and with your creative potential; success should not be out of your reach. The atmosphere at home grows out of sensitivity and your relationships with everyone are characterized by warmth."
551;RADIX_0000000000000518;Your Neptune in the First House;"With Neptune in the first house you do not exactly have an easy time bringing two seemingly contradictory principles into harmony. The emphasis of the first house is the development of individuality, to become an independent personality with individual needs, whereas Neptune stands for the dissolution of the structures of the ego and striving to become part of a greater, all-encompassing self.



If you still have not found the way to transform this conflict into positive energy, you could run the risk of deceiving yourself with convenient illusions. It will be difficult to develop your identity; your lack of self-awareness brings you to constantly reflect on what others are thinking and feeling. In search of perspective and orientation, you run the risk of being used. Eventually, you may turn to drug abuse and sink into the depths of self-pity.



On the other side, your great sensitivity could be of use in your endeavors to express your internal processes artistically. Others may be inspired by you to learn how sincerity and true sympathy can make a difference. Maybe you have prophetic abilities and access to dimensions which remain out of reach to others. The ability to sense what is bothering others is due largely to your healing powers."
552;RADIX_0000000000016902;Your Neptune in the Second House;"Reaching a comfortable relationship with material possessions will be extremely difficult for you. In financial transactions you may proceed naively, because you cannot fathom money's importance for some people. Maybe you frequently miscalculate, or unanticipated events absorb your financial security. Compulsive spending or the belief that other people are responsible for taking care of you and helping you stay on your feet, is typical of you.



In any case, you must make an effort to develop a realistic attitude about money and do not put off the issue. Your insecurity may be stilled by material values; however, you must make yourself aware that your spiritual attributes are much more reliable. Do not believe that a well-endowed bank account can protect you from the evils of the world.



If you learned your lesson, you will allow others to share in your material resources or will use them for creative activities."
553;RADIX_0000000000033286;Your Neptune in the Third House;"Use your intellect and reason for greater goals. The challenge for you is to integrate your limitless imagination into your thought processes and still come up with clear, logical conclusions. If you manage to avoid getting caught up in clouded thought patterns, you will develop an intuitive understanding for latent changes in your environment.



Expressing yourself by means of conventional information transfer has proven itself to be problematic for you. Artistic expression better lends itself to your impressions and inner turmoil, as you find the apparatus of language too restrictive. Maybe you have already had enough problems stemming from disturbances in communication. Accept the fact that language is the number one means of communication and you have no other choice but to work on alleviating any deficits you may have in this area.



Poetry should make you capable of beautiful expression, because it allows you to describe your dreams and fantasies without being restrained by closed structures. Possibly psychotherapy would be a good profession for you, or work with learning disabled children because you intuitively grasp the meaning of a word and are sensitive enough to understand body language."
554;RADIX_0000000000049670;Your Neptune in the Fourth House;"Perhaps you have unrealistic expectations of your family and cannot accept the fact that you are an adult now and have to take the responsibility for your own life. The feeling of security you experienced in the bosom of your family will always be a part of you, even if the circumstances were not as ideal as your memories. Do not hold fast to the values you were taught but place them in question. Let go of your romantic attachment to family traditions and its unity and solidarity. Only then will you have a chance to experience these ideals.



There may have been a lot of misunderstandings between you and your mother, which left you feeling confused and disappointed. She could have represented the qualities of Neptune by living removed from the world, maybe she used drugs too much, or maybe she shut out the world to devote herself completely to caring for you.



As a woman, you could run the risk of smothering your children with affection causing them to develop guilt complexes. It is important to maintain distance, a sober outlook and to be able to differentiate between people. Sometimes you take care of people you would be better off avoiding."
555;RADIX_0000000000066054;Your Neptune in the Fifth House;"With your creativity, fantasy and your deep emotions, you are capable of extraordinary artistic expression. Unfortunately, either you are oblivious to your talents or circumstances prevent you from creating. Possibly self-expression is sacrificed to a deep-rooted guilt complex or you simply do not have enough confidence in yourself to experiment. Regardless of the cause, it would do you good to experiment in this area. It is not necessary to risk your steady income to find out how much joy artistic expression can bring.



You are a romantic lover like no other. Love has to be about romance and pain or you do not see any point in it. Watch out that you do not spend too much time in the clouds or your fall could be a hard one. First consider carefully what you really expect from a partner and do not chase after ill-conceived ideals. 



The relationship between you and your children could be similar. Maybe you will not recognize the true personality of your children until after the passing of many years, and than wonder how you could have been so blind. On the other hand, you will support the sensitive and creative side of your children."
556;RADIX_0000000000082438;Your Neptune in the Sixth House;"The challenge of getting your day organized and all your obligations fulfilled satisfactorily often makes you doubt your abilities. Possibly you feel overwhelmed by obligations of keeping your household in order, the demands of professional success and taking your mother to the dentist between all this. It may also be the case, that you reject all responsibility and are oblivious to the fact that your constant daydreaming and irresponsibility are a burden to others. Somehow you do not feel adequately prepared for the cruel world outside and actually do react very sensitively and have even been known to have ""allergic"" reactions to unpleasant experiences. You should take care to interpret your body's reactions realistically. Ignoring its signals could cause you to lose touch; if you are unable to solve your problems it could affect your health, for example in the form of eating disorders.



On the other hand, you have healing powers and sensitivity for solving problems at work. Once you have gotten your feet firmly on the Earth, which may be unpleasant at times, you go about your work with inspiration and attain deep satisfaction through serving others."
557;RADIX_0000000000098822;Your Neptune in the Seventh House;"It never ceases to amaze you that your partner can still manage to disappoint you although in the beginning everything was so beautiful. Your problem is that your image of your partner was never realistic and you do not see your role in the relationship clearly. This can have various consequences. Perhaps you are looking for bliss and salvation in the relationship and believe yourself incapable of surviving on your own. This is a dangerous attitude and can lead to submissive behavior and tolerance of abuse in relationships. On the other hand, an unattainable romantic ideal could make you wait for the perfect partner, secretly believing that a relationship has nothing to do with day-to-day life. Maybe you are attracted to people with drug problems or to criminals and are determined to help them. You will feel like a martyr and will be disappointed if you do not get the recognition you feel you deserve. Take time to analyze your motivation, which repeatedly guides you to the same experiences.



In spite of all these problems, you are still capable of unlimited, sincere and selfless love. You can truly melt together with the one you love and draw all of your life energy and courage from a relationship. If you keep your eyes open and do not evade problems and conflicts, the relationship will allow you to give a lot and receive even more in return."
558;RADIX_0000000000115206;Your Neptune in the Eighth House;"Death should not instill you with fear, but fascinate you and arouse your curiosity about what is to follow. Also what the French call the ""small death"" attracts you hypnotically: Through physical union with another person you try to transgress limitations and attain a deeper understanding of human nature.



Wherever Neptune is found, dangers are lurking. Neptune clouds reality and often makes us victims of our own deceptions. For this reason, avoid using sex as a means of escape or believe that it can alleviate spiritual wounds for very long. You will always be an individual as long as you lead a human existence. Intoxication will help you overcome the barrier represented by your body in a relation to another person. You are capable of tremendous sacrifice, but guard against giving up control and meeting your demise in your passion.



If Neptune has difficult aspects, it could be that you change partners often, maybe because you subconsciously want to unite with all of humanity. Also, you could use people and live at their cost. Be assured that what you are looking for in other people has been within you all along."
559;RADIX_0000000000131590;Your Neptune in the Ninth House;"Becoming a part of a higher order and recognizing an all-encompassing truth with the help of your intuition is your greatest desire. Completely opening yourself to a religion, a philosophy or system of values is what you really aim for. However, Neptune will often guide you in the wrong direction. Whether you are seduced by false prophets or believe that only you have the spiritual greatness and maturity to differentiate truth from falsehood: you court the danger of losing yourself in self-deception and mysterious thoughts. Do not be too easily impressed by whatever gurus happen to be around, consider that a beautiful aura can be deceiving and that salvation can be found nowhere but within yourself.



If you do not turn yourself into a martyr leading spiritual crusades, you will actually have the potential to develop your spirit to the station where you can recognize interdependencies and let yourself be guided by the feeling that everything in life has a purpose. You are capable of extraordinary faith and can serve others as spiritual guide. Maybe you will find the source of your inspiration in a foreign country or in a place that appears to you in a dream."
560;RADIX_0000000000147974;Your Neptune in the Tenth House;"Probably you will have to search a long time for an appropriate profession, because it is not easy to recognize your talents and find appropriate release for them.  You are a little unsure of your place in society and you often perceive your role incorrectly. This may be why you feel uneasy at your job, and do not realize that you are in need of a completely different kind of challenge. Creative work, where imagination plays a large role and where you are granted a lot of freedom, would be perfect for you.



Perhaps you have strange ideas about your future prospects and are dissatisfied because everything seems trivial when you are looking for something special. On the other hand, you could attain a high position once you have found fulfillment. You have a capacity to make a good impression at public appearances. You may be capable of mesmerizing masses and being successful in politics. Neptune may be able to confuse, but cannot sharpen instinct so let your intuition guide you up the corporate ladder.



The tenth house is associated with the father; he probably had the qualities that Neptune represents to you. Seen negatively, he may have been somewhat irresponsible, seldom available, prone to escaping reality and may have had a drug problem. He may have also lived on the positive side of Neptune and was very loving, sensitive and artistically talented."
561;RADIX_0000000000164358;Your Neptune in the Eleventh House;"You should be able to divorce yourself from your identity and completely dissipate into a large community. With your sensitivity you pick up on vibrations people are sending and often instinctively do the right thing. You were born to connect to every living being in the world and feel encompassing love. Brotherly love is not an empty expression for you; you feel the meaning of this concept and want to live it. Maybe you are actively helping the poor and are involved in charity work. Because you are helpful, you can count on the support of your friends.



Still, you have trouble judging your goals. Motivation is not the problem, but it may well be that you have set goals that no one can reach. You also have to choose your friends and group activities carefully to avoid being used and one day awaking from a bad dream. Especially religious or spiritual contacts will attract you. It is also important to be careful in this area. Although you can find fulfillment in a group, you should never give up responsibility and let yourself become a mindless tool."
562;RADIX_0000000000180742;Your Neptune in the Twelfth House;"In the twelfth house, Neptune is in its natural habitat, which will intensify the expression of its qualities. In extreme cases, you may long to return to the womb, where it was warm and you could dream away in a sea of sensations. The material world is more difficult for you to grasp than your world of feelings, sacrifice, dreams and inspiration.



Maybe you are afraid of reality and believe that you could not survive there, preferring to withdraw and escape into illusions. Dimensions could open up to you that are unattainable to others. Beware of taking too many drugs along on trips through your subconscious, you may lose sight of your limits and become trapped in vicious circles.



You are over sensitive and open for mystical experiences, which can drive you to self-annihilation. It is important for you to never give up control over your emotions or the resulting action because you suffer from depression and cannot always differentiate harmful conduct from what is good for you. If you make an effort to understand the external world and try to find a way out of the isolation that is sometimes necessary, you will delight others with your inspiration and be able to draw from a large reservoir of spiritual experiences."
563;RADIX_0000000000000580;Pluto - The Unavoidable Change;With 2400 kilometers of diameter Pluto is the smallest known planet. It was discovered on the 18th of February 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. Pluto requires 247 years and 7 months to circle the Sun. It remains in each sign about 20 years. A moon, Charon, which according to Greek mythology brought the souls of the dead across the river to Hades the antique underworld, circles it. Pluto is the Roman god of the underworld that everyone will meet someday. In Astrology it symbolizes the masses and stands for sudden change, destruction, regeneration and transformation. It can be interpreted in context with the actual happenings in the world. In personal horoscopes one should concentrate on the position of its houses and its aspects. Together, Pluto and Mars rule the sign Scorpio.
564;RADIX_0000000000049729;Your Pluto in Cancer;"Pluto should be interpreted for individuals by its house position and its aspects to the other planets because it moves very slowly. It entered the sign of Cancer in 1914 and hung out there until 1939.



Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. A global perspective reveals the cause of the wars experienced by the world as excessive nationalism. Each country wanted to expand its borders and claim more living space. The resulting battles then led to the mass extermination of entire peoples. Also, families represented by the sign Cancer were subjected to transformations and the resulting consequences of dislocation. Agricultural economies were modernized: major changes were introduced by the discovery of fertilizer and insecticides. Research into hydroelectricity manifested itself in dam construction. In Israel, irrigation systems were gradually being introduced making the desert arable, a process which has since been perfected."
565;RADIX_0000000000066113;Your Pluto in Leo;"Pluto should be interpreted for individuals by its house position and its aspects to the other planets because it moves very slowly. It was in the sign of Leo from the middle of 1938 until 1956.



Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. The nuclear bomb demonstrated its devastating effects while Pluto was in the sign Leo. Atomic energy has been associated with the planet Pluto ever since, which stands for total destruction. The attributes represented by Leo, haughtiness and arrogance, can cause wars capable of destroying large portions of the world and millions of people. Recently developed weapons have introduced the world to violent dread, although simultaneously, progressive technologies dedicated to the well being of humanity are also being researched. Political systems evolved and then out of pride broke off dialog with each erecting an iron curtain between them. Colonial states achieved their independence assuming the entire responsibility of their newly won freedom."
566;RADIX_0000000000082497;Your Pluto in Virgo;"Pluto should be interpreted for individuals by its house position and its aspects to the other planets because it moves very slowly. It was in the sign of Virgo from 1956 until 1972.



Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. While it was in Virgo the labor situation and the field of medicine were drastically altered. The role of unions grew in importance because people recognized that they were stronger when they banded together (Pluto is the planet of the masses). The computer was developed and subsequently revolutionized industrial production. Today, a noncomputerized workplace is unthinkable. Food was treated with chemicals. Drugs produced in laboratories changed (or in many cases destroyed) human existence. Of relevance to the policies of population control is the development of the contraceptive pill in this era."
567;RADIX_0000000000098881;Your Pluto in Libra;"Pluto should be interpreted for individuals by its house position and its aspects to the other planets because it moves very slowly. It was in the sign of Libra from 1972 until 1984.



Pluto was first discovered in 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. During its stay in Libra, the sign of harmony and justice, people started seriously reconsidering their ideas about human relationships. People discovered that consensus is more effective than armed conflict. To avoid destroying all life on the planet, made possible by atomic weapons, new ways of reaching agreements have to be developed. Hopefully, the consciousness developed during this era will prove to meet the demands of the future. The world needs standards that can be accepted by everyone, human rights for example, which in many cases were formulated for the first time during this era. Strangely enough, a third world war could be prevented with the aid of weapons of mass destruction. The principle of deterrence has in turn left us with atomic waste that has proven very difficult to get rid of. Political groups, which are working to reestablish the ecological balance of our Earth, have drawn enough attention to themselves to establish themselves in our political landscape. Many people have recognized that the only way our civilization is going to survive is if we manage to increase our willingness to compromise."
568;RADIX_0000000000115265;Your Pluto in Scorpio;"Pluto should be interpreted for individuals by its house position and its aspects to the other planets because it moves very slowly. The global interpretation of Pluto is more important because it conveys deeper insights. Pluto has been in the sign Scorpio since 1983. In the year 1996, it will definitively progress to Sagittarius. 



Pluto was first discovered in the year 1930 in Flagstaff, Arizona. Scorpio is the sign ruled by Pluto that explains why its power is especially visible putting essential decisions before the population of the Earth. Its message ""Evolve or die"" should be conveyed to everyone on the planet. This era is characterized by the last breaths of the Age of Pisces. Mankind has to realize that it is just not enough to reduce the CO 2 production by 30% over the next 25 years. Recent reports inform us that an increase in the average temperature of 1.3 Centigrade will cause climatic catastrophes, and that this is extremely likely to occur within the next 25 years. At this point, it is important to tap new sources of energy and to do more research on reproducible raw materials and make these available to the world. Hemp, which unfortunately, in spite of its potential, has been leading a miserable existence, is a reproducible raw material whose value is just beginning to be recognized. Hemp is being used to produce paper, soap, and clothing and even coffins all of which are 100% biodegradable. If people would redirect a fraction of the funds devoted to nuclear research to the research on the hemp plant, it would not only do a lot of good for mankind but also to our living environment. In Germany, it has become possible to cultivate hemp, but bureaucratic machinery seems to be effective at intimidating farmers who want to plant it; also there is not enough seed available.



The solution is simple, but it depends on whether mankind is able to recognize the seriousness of the situation. It may be time for young people to take the future of the planet into their own hands because they have their future ahead of them and will structure any progress more sensitively than our older representatives have been doing."
569;RADIX_0000000000131649;Your Pluto in Sagittarius;"Sagittarius stands for religion, worldview, spiritual insights and interactions, culture and intellectual well-being. People born under the sign, Sagittarius, should be able to come to an intense understanding of these values, especially now. At the present time, the effects of Sagittarius' energy have an increasing influence on the course of world events; intolerance in the form of fundamentalism is on the rise.  At the same time, there are movements to find internationally acceptable solutions to our problems, which include a reexamination of individual values. The future of humanity depends on whether people born during this time, and especially the people sitting at the controls of power, will be able to negotiate a consensus between people. This consensus must be based on respect, tolerance, a feeling of community and the establishment of uncompromisable human rights. Thereby the ""Western"" values of a progress-oriented modern society, which have long been uncritically seen as a blessing for the entire world, may not be imposed on foreign cultures.



Instead of emphasizing the differences, it would be better if all the inhabitants of this planet accept the world community. Each one should start with oneself, especially today when the world is continuously getting smaller and contact to foreigners, foreign cultures and various religious communities has become a part of daily life. This presents an opportunity for the people of this era to carefully reconsider their conduct and avoid subconsciously clinging to outdated prejudices. When the world society is challenged, the positive powers of Pluto in Sagittarius will unfold and create a new collective consciousness.



The solution is simple, but it depends on whether mankind is able to recognize the seriousness of the situation. It may be time for young people to take the future of the planet into their own hands because they have their future ahead of them and will structure any progress more sensitively than our older representatives have been doing."
570;RADIX_0000000008389186;Your Pluto in Conjunction with Your Northern Moon Node;"Major transformations in your life which you are unable to control, and which also make you unsure about everything, may make you start believing in fate. Regularly dealing with death, misuse of power and the likes brings you strength of character and self-confidence. Sexuality is also important to you and serves as a source of strength.



On your way, no catastrophe can throw you off track. There are always enough energy reserves to get you going again, and you do not need to fear the future. You have learned to let go of the past because it is better to let sleeping dogs lie, especially when the present is challenging enough."
571;RADIX_0000000009175618;Your Pluto in Conjunction with Your Ascendant;"Through your intuition and willpower, you are in the position to recognize and see through to the basic relationships of life and assert your interests. For this reason, you can tap into the underlying sources of universal power and are able to use them to regenerate at anytime, if it is possible to do so without causing suffering. People think of you as a punching clown because you always manage to recover quickly from the greatest crisis.



There could be a danger of attempting to manipulate your environment. Although you could be quite successful at it, Pluto being the planet of the masses, it will not help you if you were to use this talent for your own egotistical ambitions. This is why you are especially suited to represent the interests of large groups of people, which will eventually earn you the acceptance of others."
572;RADIX_0000000009437762;Your Pluto in Conjunction with Your MC;"In structuring your professional life, you invest a great deal of energy. To reach the goals you have set for yourself, you demonstrate a sophistication that astounds everyone around you. In a classical sense, Pluto at the MC points to activity in atomic physics, still Pluto is involved with everything that has depth. Probably you have intuitive energy that you should definitely put to use in a way that will benefit everybody, or else it could have negative consequences for you.



Pluto deals with renewal; its position at the MC may mean that your status will constantly be changing. Possibly you will also often change your professional field. Even if the people closest to you do not react with a lot of understanding, you are convinced that it is necessary."
573;RADIX_0000000008405570;Your Pluto in Opposition with Your Northern Moon Node;Probably you often have manipulated people and are still not free of your fascination with power. Although you understand that it is important to let go of the past and draw consequences from events, it is difficult for you to change. Strong forces tie you to the past and make you invest a lot of effort into giving your life a new direction. Your interest in life's essentials such as death, sexuality and reincarnation could help you. The challenge is to make radical changes to your life and, if you suffer from compulsive behavior, to look for its cause.
574;RADIX_0000000009192002;Your Pluto in Opposition with Your Ascendant;"With your strong willpower you can manipulate the people around you. Sometimes you are so convincing that people are taken back. At the same time others will try to push their beliefs on you. This is why you should be careful whom you get involved with. The problem with it is that you place high expectations on others, and object if they come up with similar requests.



If you could somehow bring yourself to work in the interests of a lot of people, you would be more accepted and you could free yourself from the negative influences of the people around you. Try to keep your egotism under control and do not let yourself become a victim of anyone else's egotism."
575;RADIX_0000000009454146;Your Pluto in Opposition with Your MC;Gripped by a deep-rooted desire to change the circumstances around you, the opposition you encounter is very painful because it leads to conflicts both at work and at home. Probably you had great difficulties with your parents during your childhood and youth. If you have not used the opportunity to modify your outlook on life, these conflicts will continue on into your professional life. This could be due to the way that you are convinced that you always know the best way to do everything.
576;RADIX_0000000008421954;Your Pluto in Square with Your Northern Moon Node;Sometimes events make you face facts which you do not want to accept and leave you struggling against learning the lessons of life and recognizing your role in the interchange of forces. Maybe you use sexuality as an escape and invest energy there that could also be directed toward establishing a foundation for your life. Prejudices prevent you from approaching topics with an open mind and lead you to look for the confirmation of your views. Probably, you will have to change the way you deal with unexpected situations.  Clinging to old structures and ignoring opportunities for development which present themselves will bring you many trials. If you have a tendency to use other people's resources for your goals, you will eventually have to pay the price.
577;RADIX_0000000009208386;Your Pluto in Square with Your Ascendant;"With your great willpower you are in a position to manipulate the people around you. Sometimes you are so convincing that people are taken back. The belief that you are capable of regulating other people's affairs will prove to be problematic. If you do not learn to hold back, someday you could be forced to rethink things such that you are more aware of other people's interests than your own.



Pluto is the planet of the masses; it would not be to your advantage to give your egotism free reign. If you can bring yourself to work in the interests of large classes of people and use your surplus energy for important goals, other people will accept you."

579;RADIX_0000000008438338;Your Pluto in Trine with Your Northern Moon Node;"The ability to draw consequences from events prevents you from making important decisions carelessly. Even if everything does not run perfectly, you recognize the importance of generally changing inappropriate behavior and of living in the present.



Essential topics such as death, reincarnation and sexuality are not taboos in your environment. It is important to get the to core of things, which is why you are not satisfied with superficial explanations. Exploration of the depths of your psyche has made your personality stable and has familiarized you with the ups and downs of life."
580;RADIX_0000000009224770;Your Pluto in Trine with Your Ascendant;"A strong intuition puts you in a position to recognize and comprehend your true self and as well as the essence of other people. The resulting relationships will be characterized by their high level of interactivity. Inexhaustible energy sources should allow you to achieve whatever you set out to do. Awareness of your negative qualities will motivate you to intensify your efforts to overcome them.



When working together with others, you are very effective, even if you sometimes believe that nothing will happen without you, someday you will understand that it is not true. Somehow that will relieve you and depress you at the same time. Possibly you will start to work in the interests of large classes of people, which is in tune with the manifestation of the planet Pluto."
581;RADIX_0000000009486914;Your Pluto in Trine with Your MC;"This aspect indicates intensive involvement with your family that puts you in a position to advance professionally. The confidence you demonstrate at work wins you the admiration and support of your boss and your colleagues.



With your family situation firmly under control, no one around has any objection to your attempts to solve problems. Your effort to improve the situation at home has proven your credibility."

There could be a danger of attempting to manipulate your environment. This may cause a lot of people to feel uncomfortable around you; still you are well prepared for competition.

585;RADIX_0000000000000582;Your Pluto in the First House;"Pluto, as the planet of regeneration and transformation, gives you a strong personality with extreme character traits. There is power hidden within you which can be used both for creative or destructive acts. If something manages to survive, you show no mercy and let it go under, whether it is ideas, relationships or possessions. Wake up and become aware of this side of your character, because you could be influencing others to behave destructively or provoke situations that have this effect. Do not live beyond your own capacity. Be more careful about how you invest your energy and remember that not everyone can withstand as much as you.



The first house describes the natural personality development of the chart owner which is why you should accept your Plutonian powers and integrate them into your personality. This is the only way to keep your overwhelming passions under control. Fortunately, you have the capacity to do a lot of good, because you have no problems letting go of the past and looking for new challenges. Just as you give in to desperation and destructive outrage, you could allow positive, worthy creations to grow. If you to express your emotions immediately and not wait until the volcano erupts, you will set a lot of things in motion during your lifetime. Probably you have an aura of dark power that does not go unnoticed."
586;RADIX_0000000000016966;Your Pluto in the Second House;"Under certain circumstances, you could have an ardent craving for material possessions. The bank account may be the only thing you can really trust as you endeavor to acquire more wealth, because it makes you feel safe. Reconsider your attitude toward money and possessions and think about what they mean to you.



Pluto in the second house could burst all your fantasies of wealth. Probably experience will force you to learn detachment thereby teaching you the value of a home life. Extreme experiences in this respect could change your entire outlook on life. It is your fate to experience both wealth and poverty. Giving in to your need for security will only make detachment more painful. Watch out that you do not misuse your funds or try to buy people. There is a real danger of temptation to satisfy your power hunger by manipulating people with money, worshipping status symbols or resorting to deceit. Learning Pluto's lessons will enable you to use the means you have for the benefit of humanity and transform society's waste into treasures."
587;RADIX_0000000000033350;Your Pluto in the Third House;"Unfortunately, you have a tendency to vent your aggression verbally and do a lot of damage. Perhaps you have never noticed the effect of your words, although you have certainly hurt others. Pay attention to your motivation in expanding on the argumentation of the person you are talking to or riding her weaknesses. When you fight, you may prefer to be loud because this lets you feel the energy. You have a pronounced intellect and a capacity to differentiate. A constant occupation with intellectual work presents no problems for you, which is why you could also work in research. Mentally, you often question everything that happens and try to imagine alternatives. Do not sink too deeply into melancholy or other negative thoughts, because it could have a destructive effect on you.



You can exercise a strong influence on people but you should accept the freedom of thought and the will of others. Do not delve too deeply into strange thoughts.



Maybe in your childhood you suffered from an overactive imagination, but could not tell your family about it because you had a difficult relationship with them. Also you might have felt responsible for the death of other people and have developed a guilt complex."
588;RADIX_0000000000049734;Your Pluto in the Fourth House;"Probably you had generational conflicts with your parents and could not afford to make yourself vulnerable by admitting your feelings. Especially your mother was dominating and could not be pleased. This could have given rise to your crusade against family traditions that placed the foundations of everything which people were trying to teach you in question. If conflicts of this nature are still unresolved, it would be advisable to sit down with your parents and work on it. Otherwise, you run the risk of letting your frustration out on your family. If you develop a thirst for power, you may let it out on the people nearest to you. You are inclined to hide your emotions and intentions and can turn into a tyrant when at home with your family. Pluto in the fourth house can lead to a larger conflict with your family as a consequence of your behavior. Maybe you need this experience to wake up and consequently take a closer look at what happened in your childhood.



It does not necessarily have to be like that if you manage to find your spiritual balance and are made aware of the problem. You also have the capacity to keep your family together during crises and to use arising conflicts as experience for personal growth."
589;RADIX_0000000000066118;Your Pluto in the Fifth House;"You feel constantly challenged to prove your uniqueness. If the feeling stems from a hidden inferiority complex or if you really overestimate your talents, may remain unanswered for the time-being. It is still sometimes very difficult to develop a realistic self-image and stay relaxed in large groups of people. You like to appear in public and would like to take part in the creation of public life, whereby you may actually be more interested in feeling important. If you are hurt, you tend to uncontrolled outbreaks and will even risk losing a friendship in order to satisfy your thirst for revenge.



Thoughts about the effects of your works often distract too much from the actual content of your creative work. Probably you have not recognized your real talent but concentrate on the form which promises the most success. Simply do that which is the most fun.



Children can cause an upheaval in your life. There is a real danger that you want to dominate them and occupy a large part of their consciousness, or you regret the limitations on your freedom in general and on your ability to pursue your interests. On the other hand, children can inspire you to create artwork that moves everyone who sees it. If you use the rejuvenating power of Pluto, its creativity will help you to make great developments in your character and also help you find your true self."
590;RADIX_0000000000082502;Your Pluto in the Sixth House;"The sixth house will teach you to experience your body and show you how to treat it. It is possible with Pluto in this house that you keep on going, testing the limits of your endurance until you collapse or are forced to give in to your body's demands and rest in a sickbed. Remember how closely body and mind are connected and do not wait until your forced to your knees but stay healthy by strengthening your immune system and maintaining an internal balance.



This will not always be easy because once you have taken on a project you feel obliged to devote yourself entirely to it until every detail is completed. The sense of the project may no longer be clear because you are so busy analyzing the details. If you cannot put a check on it, everything will run through your fingers like sand and you will have to seriously ask yourself what meaning you have given to your life. If you presented yourself as a martyr to others and have loaded yourself with every burden from their shoulders, you could be disappointed and treated with contempt.



The challenge is to see the real demands of everyday life and to resist the temptation to use them as an escape from your inner world. Bring the needs of your body and soul in harmony and avoid the dangers of Pluto. Live out its positive aspects by using its healing qualities that are dormant within you."
591;RADIX_0000000000098886;Your Pluto in the Seventh House;"Probably the same pattern of behavior is repeated every time you approach someone and start a relationship with him. It will not be easy to find a balance between your ego and the union with Pluto in the house of relationships. This may crystallize as the attempts to dominate the relationship are played out and one of you gives in. Pluto does not like to make compromises, although this is exactly what is needed in a partnership. Even if a relationship is just beginning to blossom, you may throw yourself into it so vehemently as to scare your potential lover away.



The development of your personality depends on your relationships, the way they are run and the consequences that you draw from them. You need someone else to bolster your self-esteem and to tackle problems, some of which may have a long history. The transforming power of Pluto is expressed in your relationship to others. If it is ever going to get that far, you need to accept the unpleasant side of yourself, just as everybody must. In the relationship, this may take the form of jealousy, revenge, greed or envy. Once you have recognized this challenge, you will become a much-appreciated haven for your partner, especially in times of crises."
592;RADIX_0000000000115270;Your Pluto in the Eighth House;"You are capable of deep passions and must get to the root of things. Which area is better suited to these kinds of experiences than sexuality? Your need to overcome restrictions and break taboos takes you into danger zones. The destructive power of Pluto can drive you to your knees and move you to transform your life overnight.



All of your driving energies should be channeled into attaining positive goals. It would be a shame to completely suppress emotions like jealousy, hate, envy or desire for revenge and ban them from consciousness, because these feelings are a part of life and may be inclined to show up at the most inopportune moments.



A strong will lets you achieve everything you set out to do. Be care that you do not advance at other people's expense, you may pay for it later. The more you depend on success to be happy, the greater the danger of losing everything quickly. Pluto will teach you to turn crises into personality productive development sessions, which you should not resist. Your extraordinary source of energy will help you to avoid getting taken down and even to stand by your friends. You have a wondrous capacity to share your resources communally and still receive a lot in return. You are careful about other people's financial affairs and guard against getting into arguments over money.



Fear of death may not occupy your thoughts because you feel very near to death. The system of eternal giving and taking has permeated to your innermost being to the point where you have become curious about what will happen to you after this life."
593;RADIX_0000000000131654;Your Pluto in the Ninth House;"With Pluto in the ninth house it could be that the drive toward higher insights will overpower you, leaving you to search for the meaning of life and guiding you in the wrong direction. You could choose to follow a philosophy or a system of belief and become a fanatical warrior for your cause. However, the more passionate your involvement, the more painful it will be when you finally wake up. You may see God as a strict father figure that watches over you, demands obedience and punishes immediately. If your outlook on life has taken on these kinds of character traits your faith will suffer from sudden unforeseen events and take a step closer to the truth, which is so important to you.



Possibly you try to influence people by manipulation, misusing power and being intolerant of the followers of other religions. Also in this case, you will be forced into experiences which will teach you to tolerate and respect the free will of every individual.



Even if you tend to this kind of extreme form of behavior, seriously consider basic questions of ethics. You could enthusiastically approach a field of knowledge and become an expert on it. It is to be hoped that your wish will become true and you will receive an answer to all of your questions. Once you have formed your character you will not hesitate to pass on your insights for the benefit of others."
594;RADIX_0000000000148038;Your Pluto in the Tenth House;"You could have problems with authorities because it is difficult for you to submit. Actually, you prefer to be in charge and enjoy telling others what to do. If you have no trust in human qualities, or believe that you are too sensitive to open yourself and show feelings like fear, then you will not rest until you have reached a position where you feel secure.



Pluto in the tenth house will foil your plans and force you to change your attitude about the outside world. That can happen when you lose your job and have to completely rethink everything. Possibly you are timid about public life, crawl into your house and put your light under a bushel. Even in this case, events will force you to take on life as well as the responsibility for yourself and others.



Probably your father had plutonic powers and appeared dominant, powerful and full of energy. Maybe you still work hard because you want to prove something to him.



You have the potential to use your determination and stamina to reach a powerful position, whether it is in public or hidden in the remote areas of power. Guard against influencing the lives of other people reducing them to chess pieces; you will not get away with it."
595;RADIX_0000000000164422;Your Pluto in the Eleventh House;"Groups could utilize you as a driving force for dynamic processes. For this reason, you will always play a central role in any group you join. The most important experiences of your life will be in this area. However, your behavior in the group will not be without problems, which can manifest themselves in different ways. Determination and drive for power may tempt you to try to dominate every group, including your friends and colleagues. Groups which are anything but harmless, may draw you into their megalomaniac plans with spiritual or political goals. Lovers may be incensed about the way you carry sexuality into the group and provoke jealousy, or are only able to find friends through sexual activity. The group could wind up taking out their negative energy on you and then using you as a scapegoat.



No matter which mechanisms are used, these sudden unforeseen events will force you to reconsider your behavior and your motivations and eventually make changes. One day you may find yourself completely isolated and then have to invest a lot of energy into finding another circle of people with similar convictions.



Through such experiences you will develop your character and attain a realistic self-awareness. Disputes within a group and even serious conflicts will help you learn to accept your weaknesses. Still you are able to remain loyal to your friends and to show strength and involvement especially in crises."
596;RADIX_0000000000180806;Your Pluto in the Twelfth House;"Pluto in the twelfth house demands you to confront your inner conflicts and to learn how you can overcome yourself and detach from material possessions or even your own life. Delve deep into your subconscious and ask how you can conquer your inhibitions and live out everything currently slumbering within you. Maybe you are afraid to admit to your less positive side and fear being overwhelmed by emotions and passions. If placed under pressure you tend to escape into isolation and will never get to know yourself and miss a lot of opportunities. Become aware that the potential for many creative acts is hidden within you and could have a positive influence on the people around you.



The way to this consciousness leads you to the dissolution of out-dated behavior and personality structures. Go after greater ideas and forget your ego in order to tap into energy sources. Maybe you are suffering from an overpowering fear of death as an eternal sign of your fear of self-annihilation. This offers an approach to the task of clarifying yourself and bringing your hidden qualities to light.



Like no other, you are capable of learning through pain and crises and arising like a phoenix out of the ashes."
597;RADIX_0000000000002052;The Moon's Nodes - The Karmic Component - Where Do I Come From - Where Am I Going?;"The Moon's nodes are points where the moon's orbit around the Earth crosses the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The points are calculated and lie directly across from each other. When these two points are connected, the Moon Node Axis crosses the entire chart. It runs backwards, from Aries into Pisces, then into Aquarius, etc.



The Moon Node Axis can travel through the horoscope in 18.5 years, which leaves 1.5 years in each sign. The people our own age have their Moon Nodes in the same sign as we do, but not necessarily in the same house.



The rising Moon Node is referred to as the northern Moon Node or Dragon's Head. The falling Moon Node is called the southern Moon Node or Dragon's Tail. In Indian Astrology they are called Rahu and Ketu.



The meaning of the Moon Node Axis is tied closely to Karmic Astrology and is easier to understand in this context. It begins with a premonition that we are not on planet Earth for the first time, but that we have brought experiences from previous lives with us. In a horoscope the principle of reincarnation is described by the Moon Node Axis, whereby the falling Moon Node shows where the soul is coming from while the rising Moon Node describes where it is going to and our goals in this life. The Axis is the path we walk in this life. It can also be seen as a horoscope compressed into one line, which is expounded on by the remaining factors.



The rising Moon Node contains the sum of all the experiences from our past lives. This is why it seems more familiar to us than its complement. It represents all our favorite habits, which we cannot manage to free ourselves from, but which hamper our development, in other words our personal ""way of least resistance"". It is our duty to overcome our inner obstacles and pave the way for new experiences that go in a completely different direction, as we see on the opposing sign. We should endeavor to free ourselves from the chains of habit and look forward to unexplored harbors. The houses containing the Moon's Nodes tell us which areas we should further develop and where we are caught by transmitted behavior patterns.



One of the most interesting ways to see the personal horoscope is to look at how far we have come and then image what may lie in store for us."
598;RADIX_0000000000002049;Your Northern Moon Node in Aries;"Your task in this life is to become an independent individual with clearly defined opinions and to pursue your ambitions enthusiastically. Previously, you oriented yourself on your surroundings, striving for recognition from others. This explains why you were often uncertain about your own needs. You sacrificed your identity to a desire to be encompassed by harmony; this dependency made you exploitable. You became a master of compromises designed to synthesize everything into one mass. You probably have spent a lot of time in cultivated circles, well isolated from anything rough. You are used to being accepted by a group and react naively to approval; you are too uncritical of its source.



It is high time to make some changes. You may have to learn to push on with determination, not caring if others follow you or not. It is exceedingly important for you to establish an identity and take charge of your own life. Try to get over your dependency on other people's approval, be confident that your first step will not leave you isolated."
599;RADIX_0000000000018433;Your Northern Moon Node in Taurus;"This Moon Node position challenges you to stabilize your values during your lifetime and to overcome temptations to misuse power or let yourself be manipulated. Pay more attention to your mundane existence. Learn to respect other people's free will. This is especially important because people with weaker characters may find your aura of authority attractive.



Previously, you had difficulty controlling your drives and may even have been drawn to dark powers. You find yourself trapped in a web of dependencies and must first complete a process of transformation before you will be ready to devote another earthly existence to your education and development. Some dramatic experiences may have taught you to distrust the majority of people and to react defensively.



Use the earthy qualities of the sign Taurus and allow yourself the freedom to enjoy some of the less harmful pleasures in life. You have got to get control of yourself and to get back to the basics of human existence. If you can manage to invest your amazing powers solely in constructive endeavors, your experiences will teach you the true meaning of permanence."
600;RADIX_0000000000034817;Your Northern Moon Node in Gemini;"Previously you pretentiously assumed that your wisdom would bring the salvation of humanity and earn you historical recognition. You were even willing to bear every frustration, as well as isolation after each and every friend turned away from you. Convinced that you were capable of receiving enlightenment in passing, you never stopped to consider or even to listen to the opinions of others. Any criticism on your intellectual creations was immediately taken as a personal affront. All in all your unbridled arrogance has become your greatest trap.



It is extremely difficult to find a way to break such a pattern of behavior. More contact and more communication with others will help you to see things from the other side and recognize other facets of the truth. True involvement in your community will depend on your learning to value restraint and tolerance. This will also involve exchanging your fear of losing your prized independence for an understanding of the value of bonding with other people."
601;RADIX_0000000000051201;Your Northern Moon Node in Cancer;"This incarnation will give you the opportunity to learn to express your feelings freely and to allow other people to get close to you, especially your own family. Earlier you remained icily distant from everyone around you, rigid in your high social standing. You also tended to judge people by their status. Spontaneity and natural joy were foreign concepts to you, lost in your ambitions to redeem the respect you felt worthy of. You would go to any lengths to achieve your goals even if it involved infringing on the needs of those around you. You were a loner even in the company of others.



This could all change if you would only give up your activities in the community and dedicate yourself to giving back to your family and showing a little appreciation for the support you have received from them. Take some real responsibility for those around you without asking what is in it for you. You will develop imagination and sensitivity and finally bring an end to your spiritual isolation. Once you have overcome your false pride and self-righteousness you will be capable of loving life and emotional involvement."
602;RADIX_0000000000067585;Your Northern Moon Node in Leo;"You know how it feels to work towards common goals in a large group. In spite of your unconventional ways, experience has convinced you that constant activity in your circle of friends or in a large group is the most efficient way to get things done.



In the past you had only little time for your private affairs and were also hesitant if not even a little bit afraid to work toward realizing your own individual goals. You usually stayed focused on the interests of all humanity and perform altruistic service while maintaining emotional distance. Unfortunately, you also tended to waste a lot of energy because your goals were not clearly defined.



Now is the time to become more concrete and separate from the masses. Your new experiences will lead you to attain independence and allow your individuality to surface. To achieve success, break away from the crowd and go your own way. You will eventually be recognized for your efforts by people willing to follow you. In time you will discover pragmatism and fairness and how to make use of them. Even if you work to realize your private ambitions, it will not necessarily have a less positive effect on your environment as your unyielding attempts to alter society."
603;RADIX_0000000000083969;Your Northern Moon Node in Virgo;"This Moon Node position challenges you to make clear, rational decisions taking leave of your emotional martyrdom. You are held captive by illusions and allow yourself to be caught up in tragic tales. You cannot express your position in front of others because you are very seldom capable of recognizing what your positions actually are. These veils of uncontrolled emotionality often lead to exploitation, leaving you unable to defend yourself. Resolution and ambition were alien concepts. Having closed your eyes to reality, you could not understand the cause of your suffering. Your being was unattainable and your self-pity only added to your isolation. Lack of self-confidence and your willingness to allow emotions to control your ideas inhibited your development. 



You are going to have to find a way out of this behavior pattern. You cannot run from the truth, even if it is not always pleasant. Do not let yourself be swayed by other people's moods. Practice saying no to yourself and to those asking for favors. You have to learn to think critically and to define your goals clearly if you ever want to reach them. Analyze the situation in order to differentiate between pity and sympathy. If you want to help then go to a hospital or similar institution and offer concrete help to people who really need it."
604;RADIX_0000000000100353;Your Northern Moon Node in Libra;"Your task in this life is to learn to live with other people and to show consideration for their needs. You became used to unceasingly pushing your way through. You stumble through life oblivious to the consequences, accompanied by the feeling that you are being shortchanged or are missing out on something. You can hurt others with your thoughtlessness without even being aware that you are doing it. Your lack of sensitivity makes you seem cruel and prevents others from developing interest in you beyond staring at you in amazement. Your lack of restraint in expressing aggression makes life with you difficult, as does your tendency to think that someone will take something away from you if you do not make a grab for it first.



Now you have the chance to recognize what you have been doing and rethink your behavior. You should try to be more quiet and take time to listen to others and reflect. You should maintain balance between your own needs and those of others. Learn to make compromises and do not always think that your interests are being sacrificed. If you wait and watch you might see that someone else would like to have that last piece of cake, you will be amazed at how much you can achieve without even having to fight for it."
605;RADIX_0000000000116737;Your Northern Moon Node in Scorpio;"Previously you were attached to your possessions and material successes and had no concern for your spiritual development. Work was hard and persistent leaving you prone to rest after receiving your reward. A decadent lifestyle and preoccupation with your own physical comfort kept you from seeing other more important values. You were not interested in becoming enlightened, but were happy to be made a slave to wealth. All change was painstakingly avoided, because the risk of losing something seemed high enough to prevent you from even trying to overcome your inertia. You were satisfied to keep all your routines, suspiciously watching anything unfamiliar.



Your task is to learn to accept the flow of change and to prepare a comprehensive spiritual transformation. Open yourself to new experiences and learn to be detached if you want to profit from life's lessons. If you do not comply voluntarily, circumstances may eventually force you into it.



Earthly existence is an adventure, in which winning always implies some risk. Extreme situations will reveal your strengths and help you to develop abilities that will prove to be effective. Newly acquired free space will allow your energies to unfold and reach their full potential."
606;RADIX_0000000000133121;Your Northern Moon Node in Sagittarius;"Your task in this life is to overcome your indecisiveness and take a firm standpoint. Before, you approached strangers and freely exchanged ideas with them. The problem arose when you tended to let yourself be convinced too easily, and ended up repeating what was being said to you in order to gain approval. That was no problem for you because you were unable to establish a personal relationship to the contents of the conversation. Thus you earned a reputation for being superficial, never taking anything seriously. You suffered from your own inner conflicts and your ability to see everything from every perspective. Frequently, you had no idea what you actually wanted, searching for your own well being in a multitude of activities. Still you were unable to commit yourself, always choosing to remain on the sidelines.



Now is the time to begin your search for truth. Silence is preferable to joining a discussion with an offhand comment that you may regret later. If you want to gain deeper insights, you are going to have to be more honest with people. It may be necessary to withdraw for a while until you have found yourself. Expand your horizons and do not be satisfied to occupy yourself with trivialities. Better alternatives would be to take a long trip or to study sophisticated literature. You will learn your lessons and develop firm opinions through patience and determined effort."
607;RADIX_0000000000149505;Your Northern Moon Node in Capricorn;"Your challenge in this life is to attain maturity and responsibility, leaving childlike behavior behind. Your moods have been making it impossible for others to figure you out, especially with your stubborn refusal to exchange the weaknesses you have acquired for more resolute and reasonable behavior. You have been prone to twist the truth to suit your needs and then become furious when things went differently than you expected. Because you are barely getting by on your own, you are inclined to put your fate in the hands of stronger people who are willing to look after you. You have a tendency to be obstinate in defiance of every logic, which only hurts you. The fear of retaliation for your behavior has kept you from going out. You much prefer to throw a fit in the privacy of your own home. You wished that everything would return to the way it was.



The time for change has come. You are challenged to find a place in society and take yourself seriously. Go out and confront yourself with the consequences of your behavior; this will in turn force you to act more reasonably. You have to recognize that there are more important things than your personal insignificant affairs and that important duties await you. You can no longer evade your responsibility. You are asked to take it on lightheartedly, as no one can relieve you."
608;RADIX_0000000000165889;Your Northern Moon Node in Aquarius;"In the past you have managed to place your own interests in the center of every activity, disregarding the rest of the world. You insisted on setting the pace and were unable to let yourself be led by anyone else and inept at cooperation among equals. Your lust for power and excessive pride let you forget how much real friendship could give you and how wonderful life within a community can be. Your conceit led you to find a role in any drama that would make you the center of attention. You were not even able to admit to the same weaknesses in yourself, which you despised in others.



Now you are called upon to sacrifice your own personal goals to service for your community. Descend from your pedestal and meet with the ""lesser"" folk. You could learn more than you dare to imagine. Your duty is to devote your managerial qualities to the development of a more humane society and subdue your ego in support of a nobler goal. This will require letting your mask fall as well resisting the temptation to dominate others. You must learn to think of yourself as a small part of the universe, which can attain its destiny only through a cooperative effort with friends and partners. Any attempts to resist may result in an involuntary isolation that will eventually force you into taking these very steps."
609;RADIX_0000000000182273;Your Northern Moon Node in Pisces;"The lesson for this life is to become less stubborn and open yourself for spiritual development in order to feel sincere sympathy for others. 



This could be complicated by the fact that you have made a habit of living by strict rules. It would be better to reexamine the rules critically before accepting them as a standard. Order and duty determine your life to a large extent. Even when helping someone, it is out of a sense of duty, because such things are expected. Your innate distrust should help you to avoid the dangers of this world, but at the same time it cancels out sincerity and the ability to love. You want everything to be explainable and easily within reach. A consciousness that extends beyond the limits of your sensory perception is beyond imagining.



Events of this life have been constructed to prove that you can increase your sensibility. Some trust in your intuition and a little dedication could open new worlds and grant you access to the inner processes of the people around you. If you open yourself up and loosen the rigid structures within you, the reward will be the ability to recognize the oneness of the universe and to offer love and sympathy for all the inhabitants of the Earth."
610;RADIX_0000000000002054;Your Northern Moon Node in the First House;With a rising moon node in the first house, you should start searching for your identity and your personal strengths. Do not fall into the old habit of relying on approval from your partner, but encourage your own strengths. Exercising solidarity in the realization of your goals is not the point. Rather, you are asked to achieve independence through a confident appearance and to live according to your needs. Even if you still put yourself under pressure to become one with your partner, take the initiative and accept the challenge of self-fulfillment. If you should want to have another relationship, you will be able to contribute more without running the risk of being used.
611;RADIX_0000000000018438;Your Northern Moon Node in the Second House;Instead of living at the expense of others, floating in strange worlds with no connection to reality, as in the past, base your life on a firm foundation. Turn the suppressed drive for destruction deep within you, into positive energy that can be used to restructure the environment. Fulfilling your karma will require work in all areas. It is important for you to see tangible results. Otherwise your jealousy of other people's success will only make your life more difficult. Be willing to work long and hard for a comfortable home and work responsibly. Under no circumstances let yourself be seduced to use your influence over people to profit from their energy or let your spiritual powers make you arrogant. Be humble and recognize the worth of hard-earned success.
612;RADIX_0000000000034822;Your Northern Moon Node in the Third House;"Think about how you get along with the people around you. Do not allow yourself to become distant with friends, neighbors and family, especially brothers and sisters, and do not give in to the temptation to lose yourself in long-winded theoretical explanations. The challenge is to communicate on an everyday level and present your knowledge in a way that can be utilized. Do not believe that you are intellectually superior to others, but be willing to consider their ideas and suggestions.



In relationships, your need for freedom gives you a feeling of being chained or even oppressed before very long. It is important to be able to find workable compromises to reconcile your concept of freedom with the needs of your partner. Get down to the fundamentals of spiritual reality; do not let anyone convince you that spiritual development is only possible in distant places."
613;RADIX_0000000000051206;Your Northern Moon Node in the Fourth House;Now is the time to break with public life and return to your home and family. Look for happiness within yourself. Be assured that no social status can ever give you as much satisfaction. Open yourself to others and let them know what is going on with you. If you can overcome your stubbornness and embittered determination you will be richly rewarded with the sincere warmth of the people you love. Your family has needs beyond stability and a firm financial basis, but also love, sympathy and openness. Be tolerant of human weaknesses and do not always try to be a rock of stability for everyone around you. Give in to the flow of life with all of its changes and do not try to set positions for all eternity.
614;RADIX_0000000000067590;Your Northern Moon Node in the Fifth House;"Primary development in this lifetime should be concentrated in personal areas. Follow your heart and work for your private interests instead of future-oriented, collective enterprises. These days, great ideas do not count as much as their realization. Large crowds of people are not what it is all about, what you need are friends who mean something to you. Your imagination should enable you to spend contented hours in romantic relationships as well as live out your moods erotically. With your childlike character, you are probably good with children and prefer any fantasy world to reality. This is why you should learn to think realistically.



Sometimes you feel torn between doing something for yourself and helping others. You will learn that this does not necessarily imply a contradiction, if you remain sincere."
615;RADIX_0000000000083974;Your Northern Moon Node in the Sixth House;"Now is the time to structure your life. Concrete activities will distract you from depressive thoughts. If you have problems, do not resort to self-pity, but search for practicable solutions, if necessary ask your friends for help.



Do not shy away from taking on responsibility in order to serve humanity better. Thoroughness and responsibility may not sound very appealing, but it is important for you to fulfill your everyday routines consequently, and so avoid creating chaos. Your sensitivity keeps you from maintaining distance and following logical conclusions. On the other hand, you have the capacity for spiritual development once you detach yourself from the past and recognize the real opportunity that this incarnation offers."
616;RADIX_0000000000100358;Your Northern Moon Node in the Seventh House;"The challenge of this life will crop up in your relationships; this is supposed to teach you to recognize the needs of others. Learn to understand the effects of your behavior and accept some dependency on your partner, if you want to be happy. Consideration and the ability to cooperate probably are not your primary strengths, but they are absolutely essential to a loving relationship. This does not imply that you are expected to act selflessly. The goal is to find a balance between independence and partnership which both can accept. It is also important to develop more endurance when it comes to investing in a relationship and not to throw everything overboard at the first conflict. You will see that warmth and trust grow slowly and that accepting minor inconveniences pays off in the long run."
617;RADIX_0000000000116742;Your Northern Moon Node in the Eighth House;"In this lifetime, you should become detached from material possessions and develop self-confidence. In this context, Death, which is associated with the eighth house, signifies letting useless patterns of behavior die off that are hindering your progress. The point is to let go of the security you have come to love and build up enough courage to set out in new directions and expose yourself new and different experiences. Look for extreme situations where you can discover your true self and overcome your inflated possessiveness. Subdue the obstinacy you developed in the past or you can count on an escalation of the conflicts you will have to face.



Especially in the area of sexuality, you will recognize that giving yourself completely to emotional experiences can lead to transformations. Let your instinct be your guide and you will discover immense energy deep within your being."
618;RADIX_0000000000133126;Your Northern Moon Node in the Ninth House;"Start searching for the meaning of the experiences you have encountered and set your goals high. Your insatiable thirst for knowledge may prove itself to be more of a hindrance than help because you tend to lose yourself in details and waste energy on mundane affairs. Do not get confused by thousands of individual pieces, but try to recognize the overall picture and its connections.



Expand your horizons and fervently work to realize your ambitions. A sense of justice and love of truth will accompany you on your way. You have the potential to attain complete intellectual freedom and to be rid off the feeling of dependency on your community. Withstand the pressure to turn your mind into a portable library filled with facts; do not ignore the voice of your heart while making decisions. If you succeed you will have the opportunity to share your insights with others."
619;RADIX_0000000000149510;Your Northern Moon Node in the Tenth House;Personal problems and responsibilities can make it difficult for you to advance your development and attain an appropriate position in society. Recognition is especially important for you. Do not limit yourself to everyday household concerns. Take on responsibility in your community and develop your strengths by working on your career responsibly and with dedication. Think about how much energy you want to invest in your private affairs and consider the meaning of self-reliance and financial independence. Once you have achieved your goal of maturity and getting in control, you will figure out how to combine the two areas. You will be able to channel your emotions and offer practical solutions to household problems.
620;RADIX_0000000000165894;Your Northern Moon Node in the Eleventh House;"You still perceive the events around you from a very personal perspective. It is difficult for you to develop objectivity and to submit your strong will to common goals.



However, this is exactly the problem at hand. Try getting lost in a crowd to practice getting along in a large group of people. Put your inflated pride in your uniqueness aside and think about what you could do for others. Follow your individual goals if you want to avoid continuous confrontation with the same problems. Your ego will not do you any service in this life, but has to be overcome in order to free your strengths and imagination for service to the community. Use your power of reason and avoid the distractions offered by romantic adventures that only serve to boost your self-confidence. You will then find that you can be very happy among your friends."
621;RADIX_0000000000182278;Your Northern Moon Node in the Twelfth House;The past was probably so difficult because your exaggerated expectations and perfectionism prevented you from achieving satisfaction. Withdraw for a period of physical relaxation and take a trip within yourself. Draw your attention away from mundane activities and overcome your preoccupation with details in order to concentrate on a search for inner peace. You are still attached to material possessions and refuse to rely on anything but cold logic. You see disorder and deficiencies everywhere, which upsets you and distracts you from the important things in life. If you do not change, illness or isolation will probably force you to rest and to take a deep look within yourself. Find a way to rejuvenate and address your surroundings with loving criticism, if you want to learn your lesson and finally experience inner wealth.
622;RADIX_0000000000001988;Lilith - The Suppressed Femininity;"Lilith is not a planet but a calculated so called 'sensitive' point. Its position on the chart is determined by the elliptical orbit of the Moon around the Earth. First the points on the Moon's orbit furthest from the Earth are connected by an axis. Lilith is found at the point along this axis directly across from the Earth at the same distance from the center of the ellipse. Next to the Earth, this point is the second focal point on the Moon's orbit. Lilith's orbit takes 3232 days, about 8.9 years.



To interpret its position in the chart, it is important to know Lilith's history. She was Adam's first wife and was thrown out of Paradise because she refused to surrender to him on the grounds of her sex. She then lived with demons, with whom she bore innumerable children at the Red Sea. The angels sent from God eventually found her and demanded that she return to Adam. Lilith refused. As punishment one hundred of her children were killed each day. Lilith went mad with grief and commenced killing others. Her victims were women in childbed, small children and men, who she first seduced and then killed. Apart from that, she was also supposed to have appeared as a serpent in Paradise and offered Eve the apple from the tree of knowledge, which led to their expulsion from Paradise.



Also an additional name for Lilith offers insight into its meaning in the horoscope: Lilith is also called the Black Moon (and is illustrated as such) becoming the other, unseen side of femininity. She is not only the creator of life but also brings death, pain and disaster. She played an important role in the ancient Astrology of Babylon and Assyria, which was rediscovered as women in the sixties and seventies emancipated themselves, demanding the rights to regulate their own sexual behavior, birth control, abortion and demanded equal treatment. It is not surprising that women were attracted to Lilith nor that the literature on Lilith interpretations was written mainly by women.



In light of modern psychology, interpretations of Lilith's position tells us about unfulfilled wishes, the suppressed shadow-side of our personality, painful experiences, privation and darkness. As with Pluto, the processes triggered here should lead to self-recognition and the acceptance of our dark side. Good and bad should nt be differentiated from each other, but human existence should be seen as many-faceted.



In a man's horoscope, Lilith can reveal what type of woman he fears most and which type of woman can drive him to despair."
623;RADIX_0000000000000644;Chiron - The Social Attitude;"Chiron is a relatively small celestial body discovered on the 1st of November 1977. Its orbit lies between Saturn and Uranus. Chiron takes between 50 and 51 years to orbit the Sun. Its elliptical orbit causes it to spend a varying duration of time in each sign. Chiron travels through Libra in no more than 18 months while it remains in Aries for eight years. Some Astrologers let Chiron rule the sign Virgo, others opt for Sagittarius.



The preliminary interpretations of Chiron have understandably not progressed too far. Its astrological exploration is just beginning. As with all the planets discovered in modern times, the general mood and the situation of the entire human race at the time of the discovery are taken into account in Chiron's interpretations. Chiron's symbol resembles a key. 



A second indication to its interpretation is its role in ancient mythology. Chiron was a Centaur, half human and half horse. He was a healer, astrologer, teacher, musician and warrior in one. The great heroes like Heracles, Achilles and Orpheus were all taught by him. He also founded the Asclepeion, a center where the sick were healed and medicine was taught. Interestingly enough, Chiron was wounded by an arrow shot by Heracles, which was dipped in a poison he himself discovered. Chiron suffered great pain, but him being immortal, could not die. He withdrew to a cave and was not freed from his agony until he willingly ascended to the underworld, Hades, in exchange for Prometheus' freedom.



As mentioned above, Chiron orbits the Sun between Saturn and Uranus; between the last inner planet and the first outer planet. This key position has granted Chiron the role as a bridge between the inner and outer planets. Through Chiron's experience the mysterious planets, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, become more accessible. The collective energies of these planets can be experienced and utilized with Chiron's help. 



A closer look at the time since Chiron's discovery reveals an intensive search for meaning. More and more individuals have come to understand the necessity of united insight and action. Thus, Chiron appears to be an inner guide offering light in the midst of darkness, opening the spirit for experiences beyond daily routine.



The development of a positive collective consciousness that alone can bring about the necessary upheaval to create a peaceful and secure future may, due to the discovery of Chiron, not remain merely a dream.



If you are interested in learning more about this topic, its best to start thinking about the position of Chiron in your own horoscope. You may discover key experiences which altered your thinking and perception. Special attention should be paid to Chiron's square aspects while in transit, which, according to the position of Chiron in the natal chart, may take place at different ages."
624;RADIX_0000000000002244;The Ascendant - Gate to the External World;"The Ascendant is the rising sign in the East at the time of birth. It metaphorically channels our expectations of life. The first impression stays with us throughout the day, influencing each contact and every event. The Ascendant channels all the other energies in the chart actively working to express them. It describes the way we live our natal chart and how we confront our environment, making up an important part of our identity. 



As to the question of the differentiation between the Ascendant and the role of the Sun keep in mind how difficult it is for us as well as for others to differentiate the expression of our personality from our personality itself. This question can therefore only be partially resolved. It is much more important to live the positive aspects of your sign and to bring it into harmony with all the other energies and influences."
625;RADIX_0000000000002241;Your Ascendant in Aries;"The driving force in the life of a person with an Aries Ascendant is the energy of Mars, which rules over Aries. You will most certainly notice the influence of its energy. The power wielded here is hardly rivaled in our universe. Especially anything new and foreign attracts and stimulates it.



Whether it is caused by its power or in spite of it, an Aries Ascendant creates dangers that can take two directions. You could develop an arrogance that prevents you from accepting suggestions and constructive criticism from the people around you. This type of behavior results from your drive for independence, which if unchecked, can swell into the delusion that you can get along without anybody in your life. The danger could also lie in the opposite direction. You may endeavor to fulfill all the expectations placed on you. This may come from a lack of self-confidence. You fail to notice how you put yourself under pressure with senseless rivalry.



It is important for you to direct your energy and abilities toward a worthy goal. Create peace in your innermost self and try to be as honest as possible, especially if you cannot bring yourself to listen to what others think.



You may have problems keeping up with your own fast pace and the spontaneous course changes in your life. The people around you will eventually lose patience and you will probably come to regret not ever having carried a sensible activity through to the finish. You run in circles and when whatever it is your doing becomes difficult, you toss it aside for some new endeavor.



On the other hand an Aries Ascendant brings you the valuable ability to keep your self-confidence in a critical environment and to see yourself as a complex being deeply in touch with yourself."
626;RADIX_0000000000018625;Your Ascendant in Taurus;"Your Taurus Ascendant gives you a marked energy reserve; this is why you keep working and pursuing your goal when everyone else has long since given up. You are known for your determination, you love to work on long term projects and make promising investments. You are also a sensitive person and are very sympathetic to the plight of others.



Stability is an important theme in your life. But do not expect to find it in the outside world; this will only make you dependent on others or create a dependency on possessions. Becoming obsessed with collecting material things will cost you your freedom. On the other hand, concentrating on the needs of others could lead you to confuse your needs with theirs, losing yourself. Accept the flow of change in your life. Learn to let go of the past and you will find that flexibility is constantly offering new opportunities.



The negative expression of a Taurus Ascendant is an attachment to comfort and luxury. Your sensuous nature leads you to give in to life's pleasures where you tend to become obsessive. This can lead to compulsive behavior. In addition, you assume that everyone in the world has to see things the way you do. You waste your time with vain attempts to convince people, earning you a reputation for being stubborn and defiant.



The positive side of this Ascendant is best explained by recalling that Taurus is ruled by Venus. Your greatest talent must be accepting people wholeheartedly and without ulterior motives. Once you have found peace with yourself you can be quite generous. You are able to precisely identify the needs of others and offer them what they are lacking. You also have a sense for aesthetics and are musically talented. 



Your other talents are in quite different areas. You are practical and earthy. These qualities could enable you to create a solid foundation for your life providing you with the security you are longing for. You will find yourself by following your intuition and your heart. Feel free to express your inner harmony."
627;RADIX_0000000000035009;Your Ascendant in Gemini;"You are an extroverted person, eloquent and interested in nearly everything. Still you feel like you are not progressing enough and are not informed enough about everything. You have not learned that the key to your development has to be found within yourself. Becoming a sponge, soaking up all the contradicting information and opinions in your environment, will only lead to inner confusion. If you begin to identify yourself with things that you have only recently found out about, others will find you flaky. 



You sometimes feel inferior. This is because you do not look at others critically but notice their good side first. You are often considered superficial, although you like people and your bubbling personality wins you a lot of friends. The problematic side of this Ascendant is the lack of direction, which allows you to become confused by the myriad possibilities offered in your surroundings and distracts you from consequently following your own path through life. Take care not to place too much emphasis on being witty. This might push people away who cannot grasp your sense of humor at first sight.



Arise to challenges and take the time to put your thoughts in order. This will allow you to commit yourself. You will not have to worry about your understanding for everything and everyone tearing you in different directions. Your clear and definite manner of speaking will help you to find the completeness you are seeking."
628;RADIX_0000000000051393;Your Ascendant in Cancer;"Your Cancer Ascendant makes you seem moody and indecisive, like the Moon, which has its home in this sign. Your delicate nature is probably expressed in soft facial features. To live according to your true self you must keep in touch with your soul and avoid acting contrary to your intuition. This intuition will accompany you through your entire life. Your task lies in learning to differentiate when your inner voice is speaking out of a temporary mood or is expressing a basic need, which you should address in your plans. This will not be easy because you tend to take on other people's problems as your own. You always run the risk of being used, among other things, as an emotional garbage dump. Another quality of the sign Cancer is the tendency to cling to the past. With the wisdom of a mother of teenagers, avoid taking responsibility for people capable of taking care of themselves. If you give in to your caregiver instinct and continually disperse love and warmth, expect to be frequently disappointed and frustrated. You have difficulty maintaining distance from situations and people and are extremely vulnerable, easily offended and quickly feel rejected. It would be a good idea to develop a thicker skin; it most certainly would not do any harm. Use your brain before tuning into the mood of the people who are close to you, although your sensitive nature may make this difficult.



Once you have overcome your uncertainty and found your center, you need not hesitate to follow whims of your spiritual life. Feelings will guide you through life, because your Cancer Ascendant, as a symbol of fertility and birth, will keep you in touch with the tides of life."
629;RADIX_0000000000067777;Your Ascendant in Leo;"You radiate energy like the Sun and attract people with your creativity, optimism and leadership capabilities. You are often more successful than others, who have trouble getting off the sidelines. You have no problem doing just that, you love being the center of attention and need to rant about on center stage. With your charisma, you will not be overlooked.



Do not deceive yourself: Your behavior holds traps for you; your inclination is to be overconfident and not notice how ridiculous your power struggles are. If you want to achieve the greatness of which you are capable, then you will have to learn to use your extraordinary talents responsibly. That will prevent you from acquiring a false pride, seeing the world as a stage and defying reality to bask in narcissism. It would be a shame if you waste your energy only to draw the envy of your ""subjects"".



You should make it a habit to frequently step back and practice humility. Let someone else have a turn and look on calmly. You need to relax more, no one can hold out controlling everything for very long.



It is important for you to surround yourself with friends who do not hesitate to tell you what they really think and have enough confidence to raise the stakes during a confrontation, not simply applauding you. These friends will help you to recognize what you can actually achieve and help you set sensible goals that will establish relationships based on trust. If you manage that, your natural powers, inspiration and creativity will radiate more strongly than you ever imagined possible."
630;RADIX_0000000000084161;Your Ascendant in Virgo;"Probably you are often accused of being reserved and too shy and of taking things too seriously. You do not come on as being especially spontaneous and flamboyant. You have trouble simply enjoying the pleasures of life without serious contemplation. This lies in your inclination to worry too much and to always want to have an overview of everything that is happening. This prevents you from relaxing, because your brain keeps on churning. However, this brain has astounding capabilities. You analyze details which others have not even recognized. Your strength is rational thinking. When you are living from your center, others can rely on your judgement. Then you are able to organize your thoughts, refrain from pageantry and not let yourself get distracted from your ambitions.



It may take a long time to reach this point. Your task is to accept the ""chaos"" principle you run into everywhere, which lends chaos to its own kind of organization.



Overcome your resistance to ideas that you cannot understand or explain. Look inside yourself before you jump to criticize. It is for you to learn that your standards are not the only valid ones and that humans are not perfect machines. Try to accept life's imperfections and do not lose sight of the whole picture by concentrating on details.



Once you have accomplished this, you have done your duty. No one is asked for more than to find an inner balance. You will then be able to recognize what is really important in life. Once you have been purified in this manner, you will be able to truly help others."
631;RADIX_0000000000100545;Your Ascendant in Libra;"Your Libra Ascendant gives you a pleasant exterior and a friendly, charming personality. You decorate your surroundings tastefully. It is no wonder that wherever you go people are glad to see you and so many people, especially the opposite sex, are attracted to you.



You are actually seething under this pleasant facade. This is because your high ideals demand a tranquil environment. You are making it difficult for yourself. You do not realize that you are chasing a dream and are preparing yourself for more and more frustration. You must learn to accept certain unpleasant truths. Consider how much you do for others to gain their acceptance and to raise your own self-esteem.



To achieve contentment with your life, you need to balance your needs with those of others, as the symbol of the scale suggests. Do not simply compromise with your bad feelings but examine their cause at its root. Become aware of your own needs to avoid assuming the needs of others as your own. You can give with astounding selflessness, once you have learned to take just as naturally. Remember that you do not have to make amends to anyone.



When trying to reach a goal, you should not battle frantically, but wait it out calmly. Unity and harmony cannot be forced. When you have realized this, you will become the most valuable gift you can give to anyone. Your willingness to sacrifice will leave no one untouched."
632;RADIX_0000000000116929;Your Ascendant in Scorpio;"You do not disappear in the crowd. Your extraordinary charm, dark and mysterious, makes you stand out. You are as original and interesting as you appear to be. You search for higher knowledge like an expedition from earlier times that fears no danger, constantly offering challenge to grow and develop.



You are accompanied by the energy of the planet Pluto, which guides you into depths no one else would dare to explore. You can take this risk because you command astounding regenerative powers and are willing to cross any barrier. There could be danger for you and others if you do go too far with this. When you are frustrated you become the most dangerous enemy, stabbing at the most vulnerable places. It is amazing that you seem to disregard yourself and inflict the worst wounds on yourself.



Your desire to continually develop often leaves you feeling discontented with your current state of consciousness. For this reason, you occasionally appear to be embittered, especially when you are unwilling to make compromises. You can be sure that your ""everything or nothing"" attitude is only getting in your way. You would do better if you tried being more lenient on occasion. Your friends will thank you. You will also be out of danger of becoming a loner. It is not necessary to lose your identity through identification with a group to avoid isolation, so do not scare people away.



You find strength in letting the cycles of life and death become a part of you. This enables you to let go when a cycle comes to an end. Use the significance of the principles of regeneration and transformation to guide yourself and others to develop healing qualities."
633;RADIX_0000000000133313;Your Ascendant in Sagittarius;"You can tear through life like an excited child; with intuition and childlike naivet you are able to disclose unseen truths. You are quick to recognize interconnections and then are able to express that concisely. You are generally spontaneous and witty, a people person, not the type to sit alone in a corner at a party. 



Not everything in your life runs as smoothly as it first appears. A Sagittarius is a mutable fire sign, which can make it difficult for you to stay with one activity over a period of time and not let yourself be distracted by the prospect of new adventures. The planet Jupiter that rules the sign Sagittarius has extraordinary influence through its principle of expansion; you are attracted by everything that crosses your path and is large or conspicuous. You like to use big words and exaggerate every narration. Even if people listen, because they find you entertaining, you should keep it down or risk that only half of what you say will be believed. 



Your behavior is based on your desire to get to know the world, gain deeper insights by understanding everything and find the truth. This brings you to travel often and take part in discussions on the meaning of life. You will not let yourself get tied down too soon; if the Earth element is a strong influence in your horoscope, you will save your dream of a house in the country for your old age.



You radiate hope and optimism. Be careful not to let it mislead you to ignore your failures and continue on in the same way. If you really want to gain insight, then get inside yourself and search there. The simple and unpretentious may be more valuable than you imagine. Finding your center will help you realize great truths that will also prove to be helpful to your friends."
634;RADIX_0000000000149697;Your Ascendant in Capricorn;"You do not rush into things but consider the consequences and let your sense of responsibility guide you. You are logical and consistent, but sometimes lack spontaneity and a sense of humor, so much so that you have problems with the ""the unbearable lightness of being"". It can go so far as to cause you vague feelings of guilt and to have inhibitions against letting your inner struggles surface. You do not approach others for light conversation.



Everything in your life should have meaning and permanence. To achieve this, you work unusually hard, sometimes embittered but always remaining loyal to your boss. These traits will secure your future in a high position. Your colleges may not always be pleased about this, unless you have realized that positive emotions are essential to our well being and everyone should try to overlook things on occasion. Emotional instability leads you to erect barriers around yourself. You would be better off if, instead of binding up your feelings in a corset of rules and regulations, you ""come out"" occasionally. Material values are not the only significant factor to creating happiness. Try really taking in the beauty of a rose without thinking about the next day at the office. You are not responsible for everything that does not work out.



You should learn not to pay too much attention to status symbols; these are often bought at a high price, namely at the cost of unfulfilled wishes. Consider whether you hold to traditional values out of conviction or if they only serve to create an illusion of security.



Strangely enough, you may loosen up in your old age and live a more youthful existence than you did when you were young. Your practical skills and sober outlook enable you to accomplish a lot for your community and find fulfillment. Your popularity will be at its highest when it does not matter to you any more."
635;RADIX_0000000000166081;Your Ascendant in Aquarius;"Innovation and progress are very important to you. You like to see yourself as the instigator of new ideas, developments and societal reforms. You reveal yourself as unconventional and take pleasure in relaxing rigid social pressures and proclaiming a new avant-garde lifestyle. As Aquarius is an air sign, you can let your intuition guide you in your endeavors, which will most likely be intellectual. You feel best when working with a group of people of similar convictions. This brings you to collective movements born in the spirit of the times, even though you object to taking a position in a hierarchy.



Personal and intellectual freedoms are priorities for you. This is evident in your active participation in experiments and exploration. Simply hearing the justification ""because it has always been that way"" gets on your nerves and incites rebellion. By constantly getting into new areas, you run the risk of taking on more than you can handle without gaining expertise in any one area. You can also be accused of not allowing anyone to get close to you; you certainly tend to approach both people and situations from a distance. It is probably a protective mechanism to keep too many rapid developments from affecting you personally and getting you confused.



You should take measures not to question tradition too quickly, destroying this without having a better alternative to offer. Remember that you are a product of this tradition and are therefore, at least in some respects, dependent. Once you have managed a somber, more patient approach, you will be able to regulate things to take your individuality into consideration and leave you with enough freedom. Until then be wary of flattery, even if you find it alluring. You can find other ways to recognize your worth within your own circle of friends."
636;RADIX_0000000000182465;Your Ascendant in Pisces;"You are a very sensitive and imaginative person and sometimes make the impression of moving not entirely on the planet Earth. Your skin is simply not thick enough to protect you from all the various influences storming in on you, which leave you somewhat confused.



Opening yourself up completely to all external events will have a negative impact. This is because you have difficulty limiting your involvement and become even more confused and destabilized; it can go so far as to cause you to seriously doubt yourself. It is extremely important for you to find a relatively safe path through life and not to unconditionally follow some guru, as you like to give in to illusions.



Once you have removed these perilous cliffs from the landscape, you can let your true self unfold. If you want a clearer image of what this could mean, remember that the last two thousand years of Christianity were called the Age of Pisces. The figure, Jesus Christ, explains better than any attempt to go into the symbolism of the sign of Pisces. You have this potential in a milder form.



When you meet people, do not make your judgment on exterior circumstances, but try to experience them for what they are. In order to do this, you have to gain more stability and self-confidence. You have a cowardly nature, but in a challenging situation you can get up so much courage that you probably even amaze yourself. 



Your greatest talent is your endless imagination. If you should dare to channel it into creative endeavors, you will find it to be not only exciting but also useful. Your inspirations would enrich every type of art.



The principle of dissolution is associated with the sign Pisces. The interpretation of this should be left entirely up to you."
637;RADIX_0000000000002308;The MC (Midheaven) - The Societal Position;"The Medium Coeli also called MC or Midheaven refers to the highest point on the chart. It is the point of culmination where the planets reach the point on their apparent orbits highest above the horizon. This point also forms the summit or the beginning (cusp) of the tenth house. Directly across, the lowest point of the chart is found at the beginning (cusp) of the fourth house, the Imum Coeli or IC. The MC generally symbolizes the consciousness while the IC represents the subconscious.



The position of the MC on your chart can reveal how you conduct yourself in the outside world. This includes your role in public, your professional career, and your social position and in some cases your rate of success. The MC describes your professional orientation, where your talents lie and how you go about planning your career. There is also information about the relevance of other people's opinions and tells if you are persistent and/or determined.



A precise interpretation of your professional ambitions must include the positions of the planets in the tenth house and the aspects between the rest of the heavenly bodies.



The interpretation contains a listing of professions associated with the MC in classical Astrology. Whereby you should not consider the name of the profession as it appears in the list, but the abilities which are relevant to each of the professional fields."
638;RADIX_0000000000002305;Your Midheaven (MC) in Aries;"You would like to pursue a career out of preparing the way for new ideas. Maybe you have not had any training for a recognized profession, but trust your intuition and start your own business. This makes especially good sense because your willfulness will make it hard to take orders from the boss. You much prefer making your own decisions.



You always want to force through any achievements you expect even in spite of the intense competition. You are not exactly known for being squeamish. Consideration is not one of your strong points, which is why you prefer working alone to teamwork. It is also possible that no one else can keep up with your pace. You tend to act spontaneously, without taking time to think things over first. You hate tedious planning, preferring to set things in motion with no concern for the consequences.



Your persistence is not your strong point. If you are not successful, you do not hesitate to give up and start something new. Work is not supposed to be boring, you need the challenge and are constantly out to prove your capability. Your ambition is to reach the top and you never doubt your chances even for a moment. You put a lot of energy into your professional interests, and also have great physical stamina. You may work in a technical profession, in the military or in sports. Your determination could make you a leader.



To find out to what extent these character traits define you, consult the position of Mars and its Aspects in your chart a little more closely."
639;RADIX_0000000000018689;Your Midheaven (MC) in Taurus;"Steady employment is important for the fulfillment of your material needs. You are not opposed to working up to a position slowly, as long as it has a future. Professional endeavors should be practical, which is why you set your sights on the tried and proven rather than taking any risks. Abstract instructions are hard for you to understand, because you think and work practically. You may not be very imaginative, but are most certainly a realist.



You could take over an important position in a company because you have proven your reliability. Once you take on something, you work at it for as long as it takes until it is done. You are likely to stay at your position for a long time because you do not like having to adjust to new situations. You can be loyal to your boss and get along well with your colleagues because you are humble and uncomplicated. You need both harmony at work and also the feeling of accomplishment. At the end of the day you like to take time to reflect on your accomplishments of the day.



Forming materials fascinates you. You like working with your hands and are artistically talented. Your sense for aesthetics could lead to a career in fashion, art, horticulture or agriculture. Banking could also interest you."
640;RADIX_0000000000035073;Your Midheaven (MC) in Gemini;"Your career could be characterized by constant changes. It is not particularly hard for you to find your bearings in a temporary situation and take on new endeavors. On the other hand, getting stuck with routine, tedious work or having to bridge dry spells in the company frustrates you. You need constant intellectual stimulation, learn fast and are willing to devote time to professional training. The only problem with all this stimulation is that everything interests you and it is therefore difficult for you to commit yourself to a single goal. You may put off deciding on a profession because within a short period of time something else will seem more attractive. This will make it improbable that you will ever climb very high up the corporate ladder. You are easily distracted and unable to commit yourself. Still, your career takes a back seat to entertainment and other leisure activities.



No matter what you are doing you like to be surrounded by people and enjoy the exchange of opinions and participate enthusiastically on whatever is going on. You are friendly with your colleagues, occasionally spending evenings together after work.



To find out the extent of influence of these character traits, check the position of Mercury and the Aspects between the remaining planets in your chart.



Gemini on the MC can point to a career in media, advertising, the tourism industry or in translation. All these professions require mental flexibility and a talent for communication."
641;RADIX_0000000000051457;Your Midheaven (MC) in Cancer;"You will choose your profession by feeling it out. Planning and strategy are not your style. You bear the responsibility for everything you do and want to devote yourself to it with all your heart and soul. Of course, you greatly prefer working with people to working with machines. You do your best to avoid competition. If you do not feel accepted, you simply leave your position. Not pursuing any particular goal, your career may well be marked by interruptions and changes of direction. The most important criterion is that you feel at ease with the atmosphere at work; the career is secondary. You may not have enough energy for career goals because your private life takes so much out of you. You also suffer from a lack of confidence.



If you should get into a leadership position in spite of all this, you will have to be careful not to let your moods confuse your employees and cause frustration. On the other hand your convictions and your inherent sense of responsibility will always motivate you to find time for the betterment of humankind. With the MC in the sign Cancer you could be a successful nutrition consultant. Work with children, nursing or the food industry would probably also interest you.



Take a closer look at the position of the Moon and the Aspects between the other planets in your chart to determine the influence of these character traits."
642;RADIX_0000000000067841;Your Midheaven (MC) in Leo;"You were born to be the boss, giving directions comes to you naturally. Your sovereignty probably does not leave room for many contradictions to your authority, which is just as well if your employees value their jobs. Your determination and ambition help you to achieve whatever you set out to do. Your success may be due to your highly developed confidence and your talent for always placing yourself in the most positive light. You know how to make useful contacts and are popular because you like people who are open and entertaining.



Working creatively and developing your own ideas is not something you want to give up. You are proud of your ability to consequently make decisions and then defend them. Your consistent successes allow you to treat problems playfully, because you are sure that a solution is at hand. Work on keeping your ego from inflating and seeing every justified point of criticism as desecration of your infallibility.



Your professional success is accompanied by a rise in social status that includes public demonstrations that are no problem because you are adept at spending money.



You could be active in management, deal in art, work in sports or with children or start your own business."
643;RADIX_0000000000084225;Your Midheaven (MC) in Virgo;"You plan your career carefully and progress one step at a time. Probably you will enter a traditional profession, making a ""reasonable"" choice. It is not difficult for you to be patient and you wait a long time for the success you have earned. Your ambitions regarding promotions remain in bounds, but you could reach the top because you do not let yourself be distracted and have a great sense of responsibility. Your talents are precision, neatness, diligence and humility. You are your own greatest critic, whereby you have been known to be too harsh. You could be even more successful if you did not always insist on keeping your light under a bushel. Try calling attention to your achievements once in a while.



You are a realist, even if it is only out of fear of disappointment or due to a lack of imagination, but you still manage to achieve the goals you set for yourself. You rationalize cool and responsibly without allowing any distortions due to unnecessary emotions. If problems arise you do not panic but work systematically on a solution. Probably you are too inhibited to talk about your private affairs at the office. Your colleagues respect you for that, but do not get to know you very well. If you could manage to open yourself up once in a while, the atmosphere at work would profit from it. 



Your boss has come to appreciate your loyalty. If you ever get the opportunity to take over the boss's chair, you should watch out that you do not place the same expectations on your employees as you do on yourself. A dose of praise at just the right time will motivate more effectively. You may work keeping the records in a laboratory, or go into data processing, the health field or scientific research."
644;RADIX_0000000000100609;Your Midheaven (MC) in Libra;"Recognition and approval are vital to your self-image. This will limit your choice of professions to those that are well accepted and offer chances to move up to a respected position. Your diplomatic way to climbing the corporate ladder enables you to avoid direct confrontation. You work on keeping the atmosphere in the office pleasant. Your success may actually be due to your good relations, because you know how to behave in every circle. It is no problem for you to adapt to a new boss and find ways to put yourself in a good light. Your friendly nature makes you popular at work and easy to integrate into teams. 



Your desire for success does not stop you from sharing the fruits of your labor with others. You are very fair and appreciate success only when you worked for it. Although you plan each step meticulously, carefully weighing all the options before committing yourself, determination will never cause you to neglect your private life because success is of no value to you if you cannot enjoy it.



You could find your place in the entertainment or fashion industry, in interior decorating, marriage brokerage, or in counseling. Traditional Astrology pegs you as a good diplomat and generally good at representing people."
645;RADIX_0000000000116993;Your Midheaven (MC) in Scorpio;"You know exactly what you want to achieve professionally and put everything you have got into your career. Anything getting in your way only serves as a challenge. The word defeat is not part of your vocabulary. You are determined and can drive yourself to extremely high performance. You do not care what people think of you because you are not working to please anybody else. Respect for your boss and colleagues has toughened you up to the point where you occasionally have to take criticism for being too aggressive. You may have a completely unfounded distrust of your colleagues. If this is the case, people would appreciate it if you loosened up a little. 



You have to fight many battles in the course of your career and will not win all of them. Defeat only makes you more conscious of your goal. You have no problem changing positions and adjusting to new situations as long as it gets you somewhere. You need constant challenge and will look for activities you care deeply about and work toward making a difference. You do not like to do things half way, your motto is ""all or nothing"". You should regularly reconsider the kind of compromises you make and ask yourself if some coercion was not involved or it could get to the point of destroying everything you have built.



A consultation of the positions of Mars and Pluto as well as their Aspects to the rest of the planets in your chart will tell how much these characteristics have shaped your personality.



You could go into psychology, scientific research, medicine or a technical field."
646;RADIX_0000000000133377;Your Midheaven (MC) in Sagittarius;"Expecting your professional position to bring status, you pay careful attention to your reputation and would like others to follow your examples of both fairness and joviality. Pursuing a variety of interests will probably keep you from committing yourself to a profession until late in life. You prefer intellectual work but do not object to a physical counterbalance. With long-term and extensive career plans, you radiate confidence and optimism while fulfilling your ambitions. Your career is actually more of a calling because you use your influence to realize your ideals. Once you have gotten started, you will put everything into additional training to keep your high intellectual standards.



Your popularity as the boss comes from your policy of never asking others to do more than you do yourself and your efforts to keep the atmosphere at work pleasant. The well being of your employees is important to you, and they know that they can count on your loyalty. You always have a logical explanation of your standpoint and encourage participation in the decision making process. Pay attention that you do not start to defy yourself once, thanks to Jupiter's assistance, you got everything running to your satisfaction. You will not regret the addition of a healthy dose of self-criticism every now and then.



Consulting Jupiter's position and the Aspects between the other planets in your chart will give you a better idea of how strong the influence of these character traits are.



Professions in education, law or theology are your best prospects. Possibly work as a travel agent or a politician could interest you as well."
647;RADIX_0000000000149761;Your Midheaven (MC) in Capricorn;"Professionally you are after a stable income. You want to be thought of as steadfast and reliable. You will probably choose being trained in a traditional profession and avoid experimentation at all costs. Because your progress is direct and persistent and you do not let yourself be distracted, you will achieve your career goals in the end. You plan your career rationally (rather than by feeling) and find satisfaction in wielding power responsibly. Nothing is done carelessly. Even tedious routines are performed attentively. You work doggedly without expectations; confident that one day you will make it big. You are not hoping for a place in the spotlight with lots of recognition; you just want to be the one pulling the strings, keeping everything in your control, which is also manageable from backstage.



You judge your talents realistically. If you lose ground you look for a reason on your own grounds first. You are pragmatic and will not take excuses from your employees once you get to be the boss. Anyone who wants your respect will have to perform because words do not impress you. Do not let your career become drudgery, but try to socialize with your colleagues. Learn to enjoy the pleasant moments in the workday. 



You are well suited for work in insurance, construction, administration and bookkeeping."
648;RADIX_0000000000166145;Your Midheaven (MC) in Aquarius;"You strive to realize your humanitarian ideals at work. You are not one to plan ahead, but let yourself be easily distracted. This may prevent you from ever being promoted to a high position, which does not particularly bother you as long as your job offers some variation and excitement. You react to situations spontaneously, showing your unconventional side. More than anything else you want to do something that no one has ever done before. You go your own way and want to put your ideas into practice; whereby your only consideration is that you are doing something novel. A job requiring precision with a lot of routine tasks would bore you to no end. You also cannot bear to follow orders; a conservative boss would definitely be bad news. You probably are not disciplined enough to devote yourself to work which provides no challenge to your versatile intellect.



All of this should make starting your own business a viable alternative. You would be independent which would enable you to concentrate your energies on a specific task over a longer period of time. You could be successful in electronics, in the media or in the entertainment industry.



Your colleagues find you entertaining, unconventional and friendly. They value your solidarity. As soon as you have found your niche your creativity will rejuvenate the work environment.



Consult the position of Uranus and the Aspects between the other planets in your chart to determine the extent of the influence of these character traits."
649;RADIX_0000000000182529;Your Midheaven (MC) in Pisces;"It is uncertain if you are steadfastly goal oriented and have enough energy to initiate great performances and to be successful. You do not plan ahead but follow your intuition. Stiff competition can depress you and cost you your composure. You are sensitive and want to keep the atmosphere in the office friendly. When conflicts do occur you passively wait for the outcome. This keeps you from calling attention to yourself and from making enemies. Promotions and status symbols do not mean much to you, when they do come along you may be the most surprised.



You like doing things that keep you around people and make use of your imagination and creativity. You would not be happy working with machines and cold calculations. Work in nursing would be ideal because helping others gives you a good feeling. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, you may become an artist or filmmaker. Psychology would be another alternative.



For an estimate of how these character traits influence you, take a closer look at Neptune's position and the Aspects between the other planets."
650;RADIX_0000000000003268;Prolog;"We are pleased to see that you are showing an interest in your horoscope. We use a computer for this delicate task, but still we hope that we have been able to instill warmth and human feeling into our interpretations.



But what is ASTROLOGY??



Some people maintain that we humans are influenced by strange forces emanating from various planets. The popular press would have us believe that the inhabitants of planet Earth can be divided into twelve different types that they then fill with their shallow perceptions.



Astrology can only be as competent as the people who make use of it. Astrology as such is actually nothing more than a mathematical system, showing a person's planetary representation at the time of birth in a 360 circle.



To accomplish this we consider various factors. The first question to be answered is why these creatures involved in Astrology seem to be infatuated with the exact time of birth. It is really quite simple! We are interested in finding out which ascendant was chosen to experience Earthly life. The twelve houses symbolize the areas of life and the ascendant is the beginning of the FIRST HOUSE, the beginning of the chart.



What is it that awakens the chart's houses to life?



...The planets-each symbolizes a certain type of energy. Their positions within the houses determine into which areas of life their energy is channeled. In addition, the angular relationships of the planets to each other that are called aspects put Astrologers in the position to make statements about the manifestation of these diverse forms of energy in the life of an individual person.



CURIOUS?  You will have to be patient a little longer!



Before we get started on your horoscope, I would like to call your attention to a small problem. As you hold your interpretation in your hands, you may be startled to read that you are characterized differently in the various interpretation texts - Sun in Sagittarius: you are open, warm... followed by Moon in Capricorn: you appear cold and distanced... It is your job to piece them together, because everyone's character is made up of different qualities and you have learned more or less to live with these types of contradictions. Actually it is better to be open about contradictions in your personality, they allow for a change of pace once in a while and also provide opportunities for growth, although not necessarily without suffering. Try to understand of the fact that the computer does not know you and can not possibly present a complete picture.



For this reason it is very important that you do not get hung up on single words or examples in the texts and try to apply these strictly to your life. You should try to develop a feeling for the basic energies that are manifested in an aspect or a planet and keep in mind that they may appear in a somewhat different form in your life. Take the opportunity to discover and develop your own form of Astrology. Here you have finally found a field that is not governed by strict rules, but can be formed by your own individual sensitivity.



We wish you fruitful insights!!"
651;RADIX_0000000000002180;The Part of Fortune - Your Personal Key for True Contentedness;"Everyone asks themselves once in a while what they can do to be happy and finding an answer to this question is not as easy as it may seem, because many people have wrong impressions about their real needs. They might be convinced that they need something, are oriented on inappropriate role models or let themselves be influenced by other people's ideas while possibly they are already on the wrong path. Usually they are not aware of it until it is too late. If you know how to make someone really happy, usually you are prepared to make an effort or to make difficult decisions. This makes the Part of Fortune something like a personal code of ethics, which has to be remembered in every circumstance. It is one of the sensitive points and is derived from Arabic Astrology.



The Part of Fortune is calculated by subtracting the Sun position from the Ascendant position. We add the number of degrees of the moon to this result. A simple formula would look like the following:

Part of Fortune = Ascendant - Sun + Moon



The position of the Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant are not randomly used for calculating the Part of Fortune. It is based on the consideration that the energy of these three bodies are what characterize people and gives them their individual personalities:  The Sun as the symbol of identity and ambition, the Moon for its emotionality and its conscious and subconscious reactions, and finally the Ascendant as the visible personality, which expresses the energies of the Sun and the Moon. The position in the horoscope where Sun, Moon and Ascendant are most harmoniously working together is called the Part of Fortune. The energies of a sign and the affairs of the astrological house concerned will show you how to reach a state of true happiness."
652;RADIX_0000000000002177;Your Part of Fortune in Aries;"In order to experience long-lasting happiness, simply discover the world again and again as you follow your spirit of adventure, which does not necessarily have to involve travel. Everyday life should be exciting and filled with variety; you would not know what to do with peace and quiet anyway.  Challenges provide an opportunity to prove your strength and courage, and you look for them everywhere. Knowing that your personal successes were created on your own provides you with satisfaction at least for a short time; by then new challenges will have presented themselves, especially in the areas presented by the house where your Part of Fortune is found. The prerequisites of happiness are being active and doing something instead of making complicated plans, but most of all spontaneeity.



Your environment should not suffer from the way you concentrate on yourself when you work; although you may feel independent, you still need companionship. Additionally, getting to know people who are not afraid to say what is on their minds will provide you with new motivation."
653;RADIX_0000000000018561;Your Part of Fortune in Taurus;"In this world where everything is rapidly changing, you need something to hold onto to make you happy. You are also looking for lasting values, either of a material or spiritual nature. A relatively large need for security makes you always want to include the momentary circumstances of your life in your plans. Probably it will give you a deep sense of satisfaction to look back and see what you have accomplished in your lifetime, whether it is a business, a house or a loyal family, where mutual support is assured. This will form a foundation from which you can work, taking all the possible turns of events into consideration so that you will not be unpleasantly surprised. Probably you make a lot of effort to make sure that things develop according to your plan. It makes you feel good to make materials useful and to give things form and structure.



Try to avoid complicated relationships, unnatural behavior or a sophisticated lifestyle; you thrive on simplicity in everything and a natural environment. That applies especially to interpersonal relationships where it is important for you to know where you stand. Playing with fire does not appeal to you, it is more important to be able to place trust in certain people than to surround yourself with a large group of people who are fun to be with but who do not really know each other. Your partner should be someone you can lean on, who you can pamper with your sense of romance. This ties sexuality closely to love and intimacy."
654;RADIX_0000000000034945;Your Part of Fortune in Gemini;"To you life means always adjusting to new circumstances and observing them out of varying perspectives. You need movement, intellectual challenges and to be surrounded by people who constantly provide you with new insights. This is why you need to communicate, keep yourself well informed and think about everything that is important to your existence and society. You are happy when you can communicate, discover interesting fields or analyze situations. Maybe you are not very adept at understanding the emotional side of people, but have no problem following their way of thinking.



It may sound paradox, but you like to be in the center of things without being so intimately involved that you cannot easily withdraw at any time. Your consciousness of reality tells you that it is not very useful to place a lot of importance on something you have no control over, and so you are often the observer who draws conclusions which make everything a little clearer without putting you in danger of being hurt. You feel intimacy not through emotional but through spiritual closeness, which is why your partner can only make you happy by creating an atmosphere in which interesting and practical conversations are possible."
655;RADIX_0000000000051329;Your Part of Fortune in Cancer;"The energy of Cancer expresses itself most clearly in the wish to actively participate in decision processes that serve to improve the feeling of community.  This could be contributing an idea, organizing a project, taking care of a garden or even, which would certainly be the most intense, the birth of a child. These kinds of activities make you feel that you are part of the community and let you know where your place is, which is also something you need for your happiness.



Still you will have to overcome a barrier - your doubts about you doing the right thing with your life, whether you can trust certain people or if everything will turn out badly. Basically, it is all about overcoming fear in order to enjoy life with all its surprises. Then you will be able to help bring about changes and exercise a certain amount of influence, although you have to become aware of it first. Once you have overcome your fears and have faith, you will be pleased to devote yourself, especially to making your family happy. Knowing that you are needed and then creating a warm atmosphere where love, understanding and a feeling of belonging can grow will make you very happy.



If you have problems overcoming your doubts and showing the people closest to you how you really feel, it would make sense to think about your relationship to your parents and try to find the source of your insecurity. Also, you should always defend your private sphere, especially if your professional life is strenuous."
656;RADIX_0000000000067713;Your Part of Fortune in Leo;"Because you need the recognition of your community to be happy, you are willing to do a lot to make sure that no doubts about your integrity arise. Your high expectations of yourself due to your convictions about morality and respectability make you unwilling to compromise, although generally you can be very tolerant, as long as others leave room for your individuality. Always trying to give your best and to be a good example is an expression of your need to be respected by the community. This kind of self-motivation will help you to develop a strong personality during the course of your life. You will have the intellectual strength to overcome your subjective viewpoint and offer support to others, whereas you only seldom accept help from others. You need to feel proud of yourself and of the things you have accomplished; without knowing that you have overcome great hurdles and really ""kicked ass"", you can never be happy. You are not able to enjoy rewards that you have not earned honestly



It is important to you to have enough room to put all of your creative energy to use; you simply need space which you can organize in your own way, whether it is at work, in your free time or within the family. No matter how determined you seem to be, you need to know where you stand. Because respect is a prerequisite for happiness you are always trying to get feedback from others."
657;RADIX_0000000000084097;Your Part of Fortune in Virgo;"Happiness depends on knowing that you are in control of everything you do and of your entire life. Your perception of existence is primarily oriented to tangible things which can be explained, you are not interested in mysteries. You want to deal with situations with clear facts, which is why you are happy to ""clean up"" in any sense of the word. People whose motivations you cannot identify or who lead unstable lives are not your type, unless they are trying to get their lives back on the right track. In cases like these you should keep your distance and not make the mistake of confusing other people's needs with your own.



It is easy for you to stay in the here and now. You have no fear of reality as long as you can recognize your options. Every victory of reason makes you happy because you will always work to stay on top of things and find reasonable pragmatic solutions."
658;RADIX_0000000000100481;Your Part of Fortune in Libra;"It makes you happy to work on your relationships until you feel that you are being well taken care of. This allows you to devote your entire potential to your popularity without having to force yourself to do so. Mostly you want to avoid feeling alone and do everything you can to be accepted by your community.  You back off from your position instead of trying to convince the majority to see things your way, you work to maintain harmony in your surroundings and try to unravel complicated situations. Shared experiences, especially with your partner, are very important to you, but when you are alone you do not feel like doing much. 



You always want to feel welcome everywhere you go and avoid imposing yourself under any circumstances. It is not necessary to fight or to strain yourself in order to be proud of your successes; you prefer things to stay tranquil and uneventful. It is enough for you to say that you could achieve anything you set your mind to. Possibly you participate in other people's experiences so intensively that you do not have to do much on your own and lead a more peaceful life this way, which is fine with you."
659;RADIX_0000000000116865;Your Part of Fortune in Scorpio;"Probably you are not searching as much for happiness as to find a confirmation that your perception of life, seeing everything as transient, is correct. In your search for challenges and extreme experiences in order to get to know yourself, you outdo even the most daring. Each time you test your limits and are able to push them back still further fills you with joy. On a physical level, sexuality plays a large role in your life.  You thoroughly enjoy the purest life energy that lets people know where they came from, which, of course, is nature, although you do not neglect the other side of being human and are always in search of truth and spirituality. The meaning of existence, the essence of evolution and human development interest you in such a way that you like to track things down and get behind mysteries.



Being conscious of transience and the inevitability of death could even have a calming effect on you and give you courage to test how far your fighting instinct and your will power will take you. Basically, you want to use your entire potential and experience life as intensely as possible."
660;RADIX_0000000000133249;Your Part of Fortune in Sagittarius;"Probably you are naturally content without being aware of its value. It is part of your personality to believe in the future and in the good in people and this attitude will be rewarded. Positive thinking will give you strength to take life easy without becoming superficial. Feeling unstrained may be one prerequisite for your happiness.  Freedom is something precious that you could never give up. When you obligate yourself then it is voluntary and with consciousness. 



There is a lot of natural self-confidence in you and it is enough for you to enjoy life, discovering some meaning beyond this is not a priority for you. Telling the truth and acting on it, being authentic is more important to you; you would not be able to live with yourself if you did otherwise. Another quality that you appreciate is your spontaneity. Anyone who tries to keep you from going on adventures or letting your enthusiasm show will not be your friend for very long. Otherwise, you do your best to get along with everyone, which contributes to your popularity as well as your general happiness."
661;RADIX_0000000000149633;Your Part of Fortune in Capricorn;"For you happiness means the satisfaction of knowing that you have accomplished something in your life and have put your talents to effective use. Seeing how your plans are realized and take shape, how things move into the right place and proceed as they should makes you happy. Your goal is to apply what you have learned usefully and to draw as much as possible out of your experiences. In your surroundings things should be determined by reason, probably because you sense instinctively that becoming too emotional could be dangerous and might interfere with your progress.



A desire to contribute your part and be a recognized member of society, maybe even social climbing, explains why you prefer to rely on your own accomplishments; probably you never want to be dependent on accepting assistance because you could not reconcile that with your image. Aging holds no fear for you because you associate it with maturity, which can only be useful to your plans. On the other hand, you see youth as more of a handicap, of not being taken seriously by society."
662;RADIX_0000000000166017;Your Part of Fortune in Aquarius;"The prerequisite for your happiness is having enough freedom to stand behind your ideals without making compromises. Friendship is more important to you than a romantic relationship where each places expectations on the other. What you need is room to experiment, the company of people with similar convictions and critical attitude toward social norms. Recognizing that you are living as an individual in a group and that potential can be magnified are important experiences that will motivate you to fight for equality and against prejudices of every kind.



Belief in the future is something you have in common with those whose Part of Fortune is in Sagittarius, because you believe that humanity will find solutions to the present problems. Basically you have a lot of understanding for the weaknesses of our species, so that you seldom react furiously but usually have an explanation at hand. You are by no means indifferent to development, still you need a certain emotional distance to things, because Aquarius is an air sign and therefore has an intellectual emphasis. Do not let yourself be pressured into acting hypocritically, which in the end will only stand in the way of true harmony.  You need your freedom, which you are also willing to grant others."
663;RADIX_0000000000182401;Your Part of Fortune in Pisces;"Pisces is the most spiritual sign of the Zodiac and represents universal love and sympathy. This is why your happiness depends on not placing more emphasis on yourself than on each person around you. An exaggerated or exclusive occupation with the factual reality of every day life could distract you from making use of your limitless imagination and the recognition of your true needs, namely overcoming your own ego and conforming to the natural flow of life. The victories you have fought for will not make you happy, although knowing that you can attain detachment and not be trapped in earthly struggles will. Happiness will come when you succeed in accepting life with all of its joys and sorrows, without long-term rigid plans which create the illusion of power and are not likely to work out anyway, leaving you feeling dissatisfied.



You should work on your inner stability and try to do more for others than for yourself. Work on getting to the root of your emotions and see yourself in relation to the whole world. Your potential for establishing a deep feeling of being connected to every living thing will never leave you feeling lonely and will make you happy."
664;RADIX_0000000000002182;Your Part of Fortune in the First House;"Having this constellation in your chart you will find fulfillment by going your own way and finding the courage to free yourself from other people's opinions and society's moralistic standards. Success will come from relying on yourself acting according to your personal way of seeing things, which may be out of the ordinary. In the course of your life you will make your mark on society while remaining true to yourself in spite of any controversy which may arise around you. Additionally, you want to be appreciated for your uniqueness; when someone thinks they can go over your head or insist on comparing you with normal citizens, that is something you cannot deal with and feel challenged to prove the opposite. Then at the very least you take the liberty of doing and saying what you really think at the time, just to make sure that there is something going on. Probably you are not well known for being considerate, and at times it may be difficult to convince you that there are factors other than your interests that must also be considered. Still, subjectivity and your way of concentrating on yourself should give you the necessary drive to work on projects you find interesting. You could become the leader of a new movement, which will most likely be something unusual.



It often does not make any difference to you if you are isolated by your actions or if others just do not understand you. It would make you unhappy if something would keep you away from following your instincts or placing restrictions on the essence of your being and your lifestyle. It would be more to your liking if you could, just once, take off with an idea without long contemplation and tedious planning. It would even be a distraction for you if you were to get involved with the community or notice other people's reactions. On the other hand you certainly do not want to risk getting a reputation for being too strange or too incompetent to stand up and take command.



With the Part of Fortune in the first house, you are faced with the challenge of finding the ""golden path"" in the middle between striving for individuality and independence and living within the community. First and foremost, you should remember not to interfere in areas where you would not accept interference from others. It will cause problems if you were to try to help people who are ready to start some project only to have them lose interest shortly thereafter. Do not believe that your lifestyle is appropriate for everyone, most people need the support of their community and do not find it difficult to adapt to expectations from others."
665;RADIX_0000000000018566;Your Part of Fortune in the Second House;"You will be happy if, during the course of your life, you come to recognize which values are important to you and are not afraid to admit having a need to feel secure. A feeling of fulfillment will come from working to build something, working toward the same goal over a long period of time and having something to rely on. In conjunction with your preference to remain a part of the material world, you enjoy working on concrete topics. Seeing things progress piece by piece is satisfying. Also it is extremely important for you to remain financially independent, earning your own income.



It is especially satisfying to discover that you can manage your own finances and take responsibility for your decisions. In this respect, money plays a large role; it has the function of providing you with the things that you consider useful to have. If it would be your intention to earn money to spend on useless prestige objects, this would divert you from your path and bar you from success. Acquiring wealth may not be seen as an end in itself; it is more a foundation for building a life.



Probably you are capable of consequently following the goals you set, which makes it necessary to consider whether they fit your character. Do not make the mistake of taking on other people's values. It is more important to develop tolerance and not to concern yourself with what other people think is important. If you are financially well situated and feel guilty about what you have earned, then it would all be a waste. Do not resist that you may have to change on occasion fearing this would interfere with your development; it is only helpful to detach yourself from things that you no longer value."
666;RADIX_0000000000034950;Your Part of Fortune in the Third House;"Communication, getting involved in intellectual debates in your environment and learning about new fields of study, are the things that make you happy. Trying to understand others will help you to grow and also come to a better understanding of yourself. Sometimes you have the feeling of being able to live many different lives because you make an effort to put yourself in other people's situations and try to understand how they think.



It is important to you to receive answers to all the questions you have and to frequently make interesting observations. Probably there is nothing better for you than to see that you have learned something. This means that intellectual wealth is more important to you than material possessions. Developing new methods or analyzing a complicated procedure is also very satisfying; it is your intention to make yourself useful and to work on inventing solutions to problems or making improvements (such as on procedures or on communication). Usually you prefer to rely on logic and reason because they can help to create clarity, in human relations as well as in other areas. With all the various sides to your personality, contact with many people is essential.



Most of all, you enjoy working on every day things which will, during the course of your life, raise your consciousness and help you to attain an understanding of philosophical principles without relying on an education in the classical sense. Try to get as much intellectual stimulation as you can; without it you will never recognize your potential."
667;RADIX_0000000000051334;Your Part of Fortune in the Fourth House;"The most basic human need is to feel that we make a difference, which is why people feel good when they are doing everything they can to contribute to the well being of people they feel close to or care for animals or even plants. It is also satisfying to observe the development of relationships, to see a child growing and watch trust evolve. With an attitude toward life so strongly oriented on giving, it is sometimes difficult for you to take; at the very least you want to show your appreciation immediately. Probably you have an emotional conscience. Recognition of the responsibility you take on for the well being of others comes very naturally from within you and determines much of your behavior. Seen this way, once you have found your fortune you will not take anything at the cost of others.



In the near future you may not have an easy time finding your way in the world, where social order does not always allow for the expression of deep emotions; also disappointments may arise when your good nature is abused or if you are deprived of recognition. That does not necessarily have to change your broad-minded attitude or prevent you from doing what you want to do. Naturally, you should set goals for yourself, but choose goals that you can relate to spiritually. If you act contrary to your feelings, your plans will never be realized. Try to establish closeness with all of your endeavors such that it leads to a personal identification. Soon you will recognize that this is what you need to be happy.



Family plays a very important role for you, especially your mother. Probably it is not easy for you to judge the situation objectively, but the feeling of belonging to your family can give you the kind of security other people search for their whole lives. This can be summarized by saying that you find fulfillment in the opportunity to express your feelings without having to abide by strict rules. Take care that you stay in contact with nature because you value your relationship to nature highly."
668;RADIX_0000000000067718;Your Part of Fortune in the Fifth House;"The fifth house is an area in which people experience their creativity and actively create. Because you find your Part of Fortune there, you will find fulfillment in your life only if you are given every opportunity to create according to your own will. This refers not necessarily to the most difficult (physical) construction work; you rather need a way to express yourself to bring your personality across, whereby the arts are especially appropriate. Your work will usually contain a playful element, although you make an effort to at least appear to take your work seriously and have no problems with responsibility or organizing extensively. Although it is no fun if you are not able to use the contacts you make to polish your self-image and bask in appreciation, certainly you do not want to have anything to do with people you feel do not respect you.



The tendency to constantly wander back and forth between the two poles, society and self-centeredness, is simple to explain - you are not able to recognize which of your qualities are special until you enter into society with others, and a positive self-image is very important to you.  Community is necessary to find out how much personality you have. Probably that will motivate you to add your own personal coloring to everything you do and see it as an expression of your creativity. Another possibility for self-expression is a good flirt, which you will have nothing against because your playfulness can be expressed more clearly in a harmless game of romance. Children are also associated with the fifth house, this means that you will be able to contribute to their happiness. You can have a lot of fun rediscovering your competitive nature and take part in small competitions with no inhibitions. You may get more excited than the kids about winning a game of pin the tail on the donkey.



Also it is very important for you to defend your vast imagination and not restrict yourself in this respect. The diversity of your thoughts will create your own little world where you make the rules and can order everything the way you want it."
669;RADIX_0000000000084102;Your Part of Fortune in the Sixth House;"Fulfillment will come from making yourself useful and concentrating on your work. Luxury, comfort and success or fame will not be important; you probably want to be sure to make effective use of your time and contribute your talents to well planned projects. Probably you work pragmatically and avoid unnecessary complications. An emphasis is placed on concrete goals, reliable workers and a practical orientation, whereby you are naturally inclined to work thoroughly, keeping an eye on the details.



Taking on menial work and following orders does not bother you, if it is necessary. It is important to be sure that you know how your role fits into the larger framework of things and to be able to contribute your part. Probably you will not have close friendships with people who like to dream and are not clear about what they want out of life; you will also have little understanding for difficult emotional problems, complicated mood swings or theories which tend to get out of hand.  You are generally willing to help and are happy to offer practical assistance which brings visible results. Especially in the areas of health and nutrition you can serve as a good example of how people should treat their bodies.



Most important is your consciousness, which can serve to guide your life by providing well thought out decisions. Because you need as much control over your fate as possible, you will not be able to endure being vulnerable, leaving your future dependent on unforeseeable factors. It would be best to find a job where you can make use of your methodical thoroughness and avoid getting entangled in complicated relationships where you cannot be sure if others value you or not. If you can, lead a simple and natural life and live freely, even if others find you a little strange. The biggest mistake would be to be inactive, sitting with your hands in your lap."
670;RADIX_0000000000100486;Your Part of Fortune in the Seventh House;"To find your fortune, look for a community where you can actively participate and where you feel comfortable enough to show your best side and make other people aware of their positive qualities. Probably you are constantly in search of companionship and are inclined to emphasize bonding factors over those that divide. Maybe you frequently catch yourself thinking more about other people's well-being than your own; success at the cost of your colleagues it not something you can enjoy. Maybe you ask yourself what actually makes up your identity, because you do not want to be isolated, you even find out what other people think before making a decision. But do not worry about it; work on finding yourself by letting your relationships get deeper. Do not insist on proving your individuality.



All of this should be enough to convince you to look for a job where you come into contact with people and which gives you the opportunity to incorporate service. You care about everyone you know, whether you know them privately or from work. Personal relationships with your colleagues will develop because rigid professionalism and strict rules are not your style. In spite of high expectations of respectable behavior, you are usually tolerant of the mistakes of others and tend to place no one but yourself under pressure.



As already indicated, you usually take on the opinions of people who are important to you, which is why it is not always easy to say what you really want. Sometimes you feel that certain people around you determine your life more than you will ever be able to. Once you have recognized this and are still content with the situation, the problem will have disappeared on its own. Feel fortunate that you are able to contribute to other people's happiness that in turn makes you feel happy."
671;RADIX_0000000000116870;Your Part of Fortune in the Eighth House;"As opposed to those who have their Part of Fortune in the seventh house and find happiness through giving, you will be able to take joyfully, which is actually a quality that is not so common. You are able to appreciate the true value of what is given to you, without feeling guilty about it and becoming obsessed with finding a way to repay it. Frequently you are occupied with thoughts on how to put the resources at your disposal to the best use. We can say that it makes you happy to make good use of the energies or materials that you acquire through professional contacts or your partner. This provides motivation to keep up the relationships that are most important to you, whereby you make an effort to notice what various people close to you value in order to behave likewise.



Possibly it will not be easy for you to restrain yourself and accept that your moral standards are not the only ones. In the course of your life, you will experience that people's hopes and dreams are similar, regardless of whether they are material or spiritual values. The only difficulty is recognizing true values, as opposed to useless possessions that eventually take possession of their owner. Once you can differentiate between the two, you will not hesitate to draw the consequences and get rid of that which is worthless, because the eighth house and its attached sign, Scorpio, represent transformation.



In the end it will make you happy to discover for yourself that you are capable of letting go and developing yourself further, of coming to terms with life's cycles and sensing a deep connection to life on this planet."
672;RADIX_0000000000133254;Your Part of Fortune in the Ninth House;"You will experience your happiness when you feel certain that you have come a few steps closer to the truth. In many respects you are a seeker who asks basic questions and is striving to find the meaning of existence. You want to develop yourself, focus your consciousness and gain an understanding of the concepts embodied in the institutions of our civilization. What you are striving for is wisdom both in thought and in action; although that sounds very determined you should not let it intimidate you. Naturally you are conscious of your imperfections, but that should not keep you from drawing the power you need for your search.



It makes you happy to connect with people through personal conversation that goes beyond every day topics. The ability to teach, which is ascribed to the sign Sagittarius as well as to the ninth house, will help you make yourself understood and spread your ideas, as people will be interested in your way of thinking. Maybe you will be able to develop your own ideas about a more humane society and convince others to try to live more in harmony with the cosmic order. Do not forget that tolerance is a prerequisite for the privilege of being allowed to observe how the thoughts which you cast out take root in the minds of other people and blossom.



It may be difficult for you, while you are in a secular environment, to keep an eye on the little everyday problems. Also you have to watch out that you do not develop a tendency to overintellectualize because truths do not just come from thought and when your heart does not contribute its part, you may lose touch with the joy you used to feel. Maybe you will discover that your search leads to yourself and that there is something divine in every being."
673;RADIX_0000000000149638;Your Part of Fortune in the Tenth House;"Happiness will come when you find the strength to develop personal integrity to remain true to your principles. It is truly an art to maintain a certain position and at the same time remain flexible without expecting others to have the same attitude. Also reducing everything to black and white or right and wrong is a grave mistake because life's structures are always more complicated. Your position in society, which is so important to you, will not be established until you take on the responsibility that goes along with it and organize your environment appropriately. This is why you will have to take on obligations that will not be easy to fulfill. In the end it will deeply satisfy you to be able to observe how structures develop and you receive the recognition you deserve. An unshakable self-image will be the result.



In time your decisions will be well thought out, and your strategies realistic such that you will begin to climb upwards. Also the ability to use social relationships to your advantage will help you to earn recognition. This will allow you to use your influence later to help colleagues out with useful advice. A deep sense of respect for every individual you meet will characterize you as fair and honest, which indicates that you accept other people's limits. At least you should try to develop these qualities if you want to enjoy life, because you probably will not be able to forgive yourself if you have an unpleasant manner. Also, you are big enough not to demand more than you can give yourself.



Because your well being is dependent on being sure that you are acting according to your moral convictions, your ethics will not allow you to make use of any advantages that you have not come about honestly. Still, if you let yourself be misled, it will get in the way of your own happiness because you will secretly punish yourself with guilt. For this reason it will be necessary for you to be sure about what you find to be legitimate. Just do not make the mistake of undergoing constant self-examination and destroying all spontaneity."
674;RADIX_0000000000166022;Your Part of Fortune in the Eleventh House;"Nothing makes you as happy as knowing that you are free to decide and that you have every opportunity. Only from this foundation are you capable of following a group instinct and making friends. Nothing will come from pressure but a defiant attitude. It may seem paradox, but you will recognize that the freer you feel, the more willing you will be to take on responsibility and then also to put effort into fulfilling it.



You need to have people around with whom you feel spiritually connected and who inspire you to develop universal ideas. Within a group you demonstrate your ability to aim your thoughts on the future and you air your ideas about the development of humanity. Probably people consider you witty or simply unusual because you surround yourself with unconventional personalities and enjoy exchanging opinions. It is a part of your personality to spread your ideas and to question everything you meet up with. Probably you will have enough energy to put your ideas into practice or at least to take the first step, as long as you surround yourself with people who are able to establish a community based on common convictions and you can work together toward common goals. Your drive to be creative in the group is so great that you find every activity and every area interesting.



The eleventh house is the opposite of the fifth house, where the will to present yourself has an emotional basis. Here your will has a stronger intellectual emphasis. A relationship may be impersonal in some respect and might be based more on intellectual closeness than on emotions. Nevertheless, you can be very loyal and conscientiously stand by your friends. Deepening friendships that challenge you intellectually and bring you to reflect will make you happy."
675;RADIX_0000000000182406;Your Part of Fortune in the Twelfth House;"You will be happy as soon as you have developed the maturity to distance yourself from the stress of every day life, and find enough peace to look inside yourself. The twelfth house is the house of detachment, so that material success, money or recognition will not fulfill your Part of Fortune. You will not be happy until you have recognized that you do not need any of that. Maybe the path to this insight will not be easy, but you will be rewarded in the end by finding happiness within you; you alone are the key. With this, you will feel connected to every living thing and feel a kind of universal love that will bring you great joy. By making contact to your innermost being you could reach a higher level of consciousness.



To get there, you should free yourself from primary needs and concentrate on your spiritual well being. Do not let yourself be distracted from your drive for success or even unconscious reactions to everyday events. Try to avoid judging people, which will only serve to get you involved because you identify with the circumstances. It is your challenge to become independent and use this as a basis to contact people who are completely different from you. This position allows you to understand the world with your heart.  As with people who have their Part of Fortune in the ninth house you, are concerned with wisdom and truth, but your intellect is not involved as much as your soul is. By recognizing yourself and your human traits, you also find out about the meaning of your existence. Intuitive understanding will help more than hours of intellectual contemplation."
676;KOMBIN_0000000000000004;The meaning of the Sun in the Composite/Combine;"The Sun's position is especially important to the interpretation of the Composite/Combine charts. It serves to identify the basic character of the relationship and determines the kind of energy which dominates as well as the areas of life which are influenced by these energies. The Sun's position describes the quality of the relationship, visible from the outside and the dynamics produced by the union of two people. This makes it a symbol for the definitive topic for the two of you.



If the Sun receives challenging aspects, it is an indication that your relationship has some problems which you have to contend with, which will call for special effort and compromises if it is to lead to a satisfying relationship. Whereas harmonious aspects indicate a common basic drive based on shared convictions. This may prevent conflicts from arising or make those that do show up easy to resolve.



Because the Sun stands for the ability to express yourself in the regular natal chart, your position in the Composite/Combine will demonstrate your ability to develop independently of one another or to suppress aspects of your personality which will make you dissatisfied in the long run."

In contrast to the older method of Synastry, the principle of Composite and Combine is to take two individual horoscopes to create a basis for a new single interpretation. Calculating a Composite this is done by finding the midpoints between the same planets in the birth charts of two people, such as the midpoint between his and her Sun. The ascendants are calculated the same way. In theory, the two points should always lie opposite each other, because the calculations are based on a circle, the Zodiac. All the relevant points are determined by a visual estimation of the shorter distance ""between"" the planets. At this point the energies are stronger and therefore have a more intense expression.



Calculating a Combine is somewhat different. Here we take the dates of birth and the geographical positions of the places of birth into account and find the geographical middle as well as the exact birthday (date and time) in the middle and use these to construct the Combine chart.



These method of calculating the energies between people has become popular with Astrologers. The principle behind it takes into account that individuals in interaction with another previously unknown person often display behavior which they havent yet become aware of in themselves or which hasnt come up in other relationships.



Every relationship develops its own dynamics and should therefore have its own horoscope. Keep this in mind whenever you notice deviations from your birth horoscope. If the new partnership leads to new behavior and personality traits, it should be seen as a contribution to your character development. In our opinion, this is also the case when people are encouraged to admit weaknesses.



Basically the following is more an interpretation of the romantic relationship between you and another person, than a business relationship. Thereby the principle of the Composite/Combine can be transferred to every kind of human contact, no matter how different they may be. If you have been doing Astrology for a longer period of time, your experience will be helpful because basically a Composite/Combine is not interpreted any differently than a natal chart. As was already stated, the challenge is to come up with original thoughts and research, for this is still the most productive way of conducting Astrology.



In conclusion, we would like to call attention to the use of gender in the interpretations. The masculine and feminine pronouns used in the texts are not intended to imply that the interpretations are more valid for one sex than the other. The genders are randomly chosen. This is only due to the fact that the English language lacks pronouns which apply to both sexes.



Hopefully, you are now curious enough to devote your attention to the following pages while retaining a critical outlook. As with all of our texts, we wish you fruitful insights!"

If the Moon receives harmonious aspects you will feel at ease with each other and maybe even feel like you have known each other for a long time, because the Moon symbolizes the past. You won't need a lot of words to understand each other and closeness, warmth and trust should develop quickly.



If the Moon has challenging aspects or if it's in a less favorable house, it may be difficult for you to talk about your feelings and everything that is going on inside you. You may even have an uneasy feeling that something isn't quite right with the relationship and you aren't able to get to the root of the problem. The house position will also tell you which area of life holds the greatest emotional conflicts, while the Moon's aspects tell about the quality of emotions in the partnership and how they effect the other factors."

Its position tells how well you understand each other, what your conversations are about and if your thought structures are similar. The dynamics of thought is expressed in the relationship; you can recognize the extent to which you can delve into your partner's thoughts and if you come to share the same convictions. Also Mercury's position tells you how honest you are with each other and if you express your thoughts openly. In many relationships it can be observed that there is simply not enough interactive communication; the Composite/Combine Mercury is put out of action.



If Mercury has challenging aspects it may indicate that your communication often ends in misunderstandings and you often talk on different levels. The aspects represent the remaining factors influencing your intellectual bond to each other. A well-placed Mercury will have a favorable effect on the relationship because the danger of misunderstandings will be minimized and disappointments can often be avoided. It also indicates that organizing every day life doesn't pose any great problems and can be approached in a similar manner."

It gives information about your ability to love and about what love means to you and what role it plays in your day to day life. You may even come to understand how you came to be attracted to each other. It's not a matter of stability or having a life together, but rather the inexplicable emotions and impulses which keep two people together. This refers to the satisfaction and joy you feel from deep within, which evades  reason and all attempts of discipline. If Venus is in a favorable position it should be an indication that you can get close to each other, share everything without holding back and genuinely feel good about the relationship while its aspects describe the factors which have a supporting or disturbing influence on the way you feel for each other.

Mars doesnt ask about the consequences of anything it does, it just forges on ahead, so that if Mars has challenging aspects it could present problems whenever you act without thinking. This is because neither of you are willing to take control or there is no way of compensating for your overactive drive and slowing it down.



In a romantic relationship, its position will provide a basis for an interpretation of sexuality and describe the emphasis placed on it in the relationship. An unfavorable Mars position could indicate a tendency to use sex as a way of carrying out conflicts, turning it into a power struggle. If one of you has too low or too high self esteem it will result in submissive or domineering behavior. A favorable Mars position may indicate that you both have a healthy ego and are capable of satisfying your needs without infringing on your partner."

The area containing Jupiter will also give you the opportunity to make the most out of what you have and to realize humanistic ideals in your relationship. Maybe after this lesson you will see how certain problems from the past are solved in the relationship.

It basically stands for the spiritual side of a partnership, cherishing your partner and giving him/her unconditional love and affection. There is a reason that Neptune is called the higher octave of Venus, because it represents selfless giving; which can also lead to abuse and completely giving up on oneself, when it reaches a negative extreme. The area of life symbolized by this house also harbors the tendency for long-term self-deception and chasing ideals, which can never be attained.

One especially positive aspect is that each is given enough space for further development. Each supports the other and is willing to admit his own weaknesses without hesitation. This will allow you to form a strong union which will stand up to any opposition. It is very important not to carry out your conflicts in public, and demonstrate how well you complement each other and that your personalities work to help each other mature. It would be safe to assume that the relationship will last a long time and that your partner will help you to see things more clearly. It will also provide both of you with the best opportunities to emphasize the positive sides of your personality and to achieve success by concentrating your energies on one goal which would remain elusive to either of you alone. Maybe others think of you as a power couple, because you always manage to get the people around you excited about starting new projects.

The Sun in this house will provide you with communal roots and your ambitions will be directed towards creating a secure foundation; which is less a question of financial interests than of establishing a feeling of belonging. Probably you live together and take exchanges of insights into the inner world of the other for granted and consider it a prerequisite for harmony. You will never drift apart from each other, but always try to stay in touch and share as many experiences with each other as possible. All of this could stabilize the relationship and help to ensure its longevity. Rest assured that you know each other well and that intimacy is important to both of you. You open yourselves to each other and share common views about life together.



Possibly you prefer to spend a quiet evening relaxing in your living room to going out and meeting people. Which is okay as long as you dont withdraw from others thinking that your partner will be capable of fulfilling every need for the rest of your life. Try to maintain some independence from each other in order to see the other from a somewhat objective distance."

Maybe one of you believes that youre giving more than you are getting out of the relationship. The resulting frustration may lead to a break up. Generally the sixth house is an unfavorable position for the Composite or Combine Moon, because here emotions are more often suppressed than they are openly expressed. Dont make it your obligation to take care of your partner, but think about how much of what you do is voluntary. You have the potential to help each other without restrictions and to support each other in all situations, still there is the danger that your conscience will pressure you into it because your expectations of a perfect relationship are very high.



Allow yourself some freedom, show no tolerance for inconsistencies and dont force your emotions into a tight corset. If you really want to understand your partner better, then try being more lenient with yourself. You shouldnt forbid yourself to feel the less pleasant emotions once in a while and allow yourself to become furious sometimes. This will enliven the relationship. The positive side of the Moon in the sixth house is the feeling that you can rely on your partner in any and every situation."

Therefore you appreciate each other as you are and are happy to be increasingly more honest with each other.

Once you have overcome this hurdle, you will be able to have a happy relationship where kids will play a large role.



This Moon position is also advantageous for business relations, because you will have a lot of ideas and can be especially successful in the entertainment sector or in advertising."

If you work together in some way, Mercurys position will be a great help to you, because you are capable of logical thought and certain judgment. Together you will find the most effective path and not let yourself be taken advantage of."

You like discussions in large groups and love to encounter new ideas. Your future life together interests you the most, probably you make a lot of plans and share your visions with each other. Most likely your thinking is characterized by optimism and fundamental joy of life, which is why you like to be seen in social settings and want to be an example for all your friends. You spend your free time studying, which wouldnt be surprising if Astrology and other related fields were to arouse your interest. What is important to you is to continue your intellectual development, which gives your partner and your friends a lot of satisfaction.



Conservative thoughts or prejudices have no place in your relationship, which is unusually progressive and equal. It is important to you not to restrict each other and to allow for everything possible at least in theory."

There is a potential within you to grasp subconscious motivations and routines and to experience great changes. You are sure that you develop a different psychology and reflexes as a couple than you would have as two individuals; you also prefer to examine this process intellectually. It is important to you to understand your partner with body and soul.



Still Mercury in the twelfth house harbors dangers which you should pay special attention to. If there are challenging aspects, you will be inclined to take on the dominant role in the relationship. In time you will reach deeper insights of the inner processes of your partner, such that you are conscious of your responsibility and guard against pushing your partner into a corner or causing pain with verbal attacks below the belt. That could go so far as to prevent all intellectual exchange and create a lot of problems. In addition you have a tendency to withdraw from your environment for discussions about topics which could be examined in more depth in a larger group."

Probably you wont need anyones help to stay on your feet, because accepting help would conflict with your self image. It is very possible that some day you will go into business for yourself or start some other projects with the intention of increasing your wealth. You shouldnt overdo it, because that would make a harmonious partnership more difficult for you to express tenderness beyond a certain degree.



If Mars is receiving challenging aspects, you may have a tendency to define yourself by your possessions and base your self image on status and reputation. At times your frustration over an unhappy relationship can lead you to devote yourself to material things in order to forget your troubles."

The fourth house basically stands for the root of the individual; this can cause problems to occur if Mars receives challenging aspects.

These problems can be overcome only by long, honest talks through which you will come to understand why your partner has certain ideas about the way a home should be.

You dont fight every change, but have the courage to leave parts of your life behind in order to integrate the new. Maybe you will make the most interesting discoveries in the area of sexuality although an examination of the cycles of life seems to have an effect on you. The relationship will give you the strength to size up unpleasant and shocking experiences and keep faith in your abilities. Going through the high and low periods will strengthen your feeling of togetherness and your loyalty which is extremely important to you.



If you are open to each other and dont make secrets of your convictions and outlook on life, the relationship will leave an impression on you which may last far longer than the relationship itself. If you manage your finances together, you will have no trouble multiplying your wealth, also there may be an inheritance. And if you should ever need financial assistance, this will be relatively easy to negotiate."

You invest all of your abilities in the relationship and experience the union as an extension of your potential and an enrichment to your life. Maybe you will recognize for the first time, the extent of influence another persons personality can exercise on your development without being strenuous. You can be glad to have a fixed common foundation based on your values and mutual respect. Possibly you will finally develop enough self confidence to realize dreams you have been holding on to for a long time. These should lead to a deep satisfaction and tranquillity which no one will be able to take away from you.



Certainly you dont take your relationship lightly and will eventually be able to place high expectations on your partner, which may become a problem if Jupiter receives unfavorable aspects. Otherwise you will be happy with each other and able to appreciate having found an open and generous partner who doesnt try to restrict you. Every kind of relationship will benefit from this constellation."

Probably you will do more for your partner than you have in past relationships, invest a lot of energy and in return be respected for your loyalty. Neither of you feels like youre losing out on something by restricting yourselves in favor of your partner. Your strength and self respect are based on the experience that everything that you give whole-heartedly will eventually have positive consequences. Also working together will improve your concentration and attention to detail without turning you into a square or making you lose sight of the big picture.



Business or professional connections will benefit from this constellation and will be characterized by careful planning and realistic estimations of the situation. If Jupiter were to receive challenging aspects, you could become excessively helpful, turning yourself into a martyr in order to keep your conscience clean.



Make sure that your loyalty stays on a close personal level. Try to avoid helping people merely for the sake of rational and distanced ethical principals. Otherwise you can forget everything you are trying to achieve together."

For this reason you are well protected from unpleasant surprises but should try not to neglect having fun. Your views are probably very conservative and arent likely to change any time soon; your outlook on life is based on the attitude that everyone has to do her part to keep the system running smoothly and expecting help only once you have made every effort. You see your relationship as ""rational"" as you confirm each others philosophy of life. If Saturn receives challenging aspects then it may be just the opposite whereby your differing outlooks on life could lead to conflicts.

However, you could have a tendency to become embittered and hold on to conventional ways instead of managing your life with light-heartedness and imagination. You see your partner as someone who can strengthen your personality and will offer you support without expecting more from you than you can give because both of you try to maintain realistic judgment.



Possibly you place too many restrictions on yourself and let your partner get you involved in difficult projects so that there is no time left for entertainment and leisure time activities and you feel like your strength has been sapped. In a professional partnership, Saturn in the tenth house will prove to be very useful because you will be able to estimate your opportunities well and motivate each other well."

Possibly there is no emphasis on hobbies and socializing with lots of people in your relationship because you are unsure of what you should do to be at ease and to get along with other people. In spite of all this, it is important that you dont concentrate only on your partner, but stay in contact with other people. Probably you dont have a large circle of friends, but only a few good friends in whom you can place your trust. Because you avoid using words like friendship and solidarity carelessly, you will probably stay together for a long time.



In less favorable circumstances you could have difficulties and have a more casual relationship, which explains the stiff, reserved atmosphere. Maybe you should start to talk about your ideals and dreams because that is what the eleventh house is all about."

You appreciate being able to exchange ideas and dreams about the future with your partner, you will probably agree with each other in this area a lot of the time, which is why you are able to animate others and bring parties to life.



For both of you it is very important for every facet of your personality to find expression within the relationship. If one of you should start to put your partner under pressure, even if it is subtle, it may put a sudden end to your happiness together, because there is nothing you cherish as much as your freedom. Possibly you have an open relationship and give your partner enough space to reorient herself at any time. Letting go is something which you would regret, but it isnt more pain than you can deal with.

889;KOMPOSIT_0000000000000454;Uranus in the first house;"Your relationship is virtually unpredictable, but that probably doesnt matter because it is spontaneity which attracts you to each other. Maybe your relationship began with a rush of intense emotion and you will one day storm away from each other just as suddenly, because the other person animates you not to waste time but to act immediately. You appreciate being able to exchange ideas and dreams about the future with your partner, you will probably agree with each other in this area a lot of the time, which is why you are able to animate others and bring parties to life.



For both of you it is very important for every facet of your personality to find expression within the relationship. If one of you should start to put your partner under pressure, even if it is subtle, it may put a sudden end to your happiness together, because there is nothing you cherish as much as your freedom. Possibly you have an open relationship and give your partner enough space to reorient herself at any time. Letting go is something which you would regret, but it isnt more pain than you can deal with.

It would be better not to rely so heavily on your intuition and premonitions but to ask openly if your partner is satisfied or not.

Crude language or open confrontation will occur rather seldom, which doesnt imply that there wont be disagreements which simply arent addressed.

In case Neptune is harmoniously aspected you will have an amazing intuition, regarding your income and multiplying your wealth.

Together you will be conscious that the power to determine your future lies in your own hands. You will develop energy, courage, and strength, will be able to spread enthusiasm for your ambitions which will help you to achieve everything you set out to do. You wont tolerate interruptions in your social climb for very long and will quickly find alternatives.



You will notice the character of this constellation especially if you work together. You work determined and may reach the highest positions, you just have to watch out that you arent ruthless and crush people in your way, or you wont be able to enjoy your success for very long. It would be better for you to take breaks for relaxation, if you get too determined, you will make mistakes which could force you back into social isolation. In the worst case you are your stiffest competition. If you try to combine your private relationship with your professional, maybe in order to go into business for yourself, you should make sure that you learn to respect your partners achievements wholeheartedly, since there might be a danger of you starting to envy each others successes."

You wont let yourself be so easily impressed by well thought out speeches, but will be convinced of the truth which you believe to have discovered (at least for yourself). Your thoughts go deeper, the spirit will be schooled and the verbal expression constantly improved, so that when you make appearances together as a couple, you will be able to convince others to see things the way you do. You believe in your convictions and dont let anyone influence you except of course your partner. Although your philosophy of life is certainly interesting and you have charisma, you should be careful to becoming ruthless and practice tolerance whenever anyone disagrees with you, otherwise people will oppose your certitude. In any case it wouldnt be good for you to live isolated in your own little world.



Probably you entered the relationship with certain intentions, which you will have to put on the shelf eventually. The union will challenge you to value your intellectual freedom and create harmony wherever possible. Maybe you will come to feel that everything is one and that each person exercises influence on the development of the planet at every second of her life."

You want to make new intensive experiences with the help of your partner and give the relationship a chance to delve into new depths. Probably you will experience extreme phases of coming closer together and then drifting apart again which will have important effects on your personality and your psyche. In the end you will recognize what it was which brought you together and in which direction you want to head.



If you have an erotic relationship, it will be filled with passionate emotions. Nothing will remain on the surface; what you would most like is for the two of you to merge together and melt into each other whereby a union on a physical level offers an especially suitable expression. Although it may be difficult because this involves a basic contradiction to the character of this constellation, it will be your challenge to stay conscious of your behavior and your expectations and to judge them as objectively as possible. If you lose your sense of judgment, it will result in complications leading to dependencies. If your conscience is complex as well as open, you will be able to profit from each other in a way which is possible for only very few couples."

If you work on planning a life together, you will try to bring about the necessary changes in yourself and without looking back.

You could push each other to higher achievements, but have to watch out that you dont just reach perfection, but are also capable of overlooking imperfections. Your expectations and the type of behavior you insist on could make it difficult for your partner to display the true personality.



Maybe you dont give each other enough and keep yourselves poised for action such that simply having fun is often neglected. You could see your life together as kind of competition in which only the best survive and this attitude could put you under a lot of pressure. Once your patience has run out and you cant bear the tension any more, you will suddenly show emotions with an intensity which will surprise even you because you usually try to keep the darker side of your personality under control and not to burden your relationship with it. You should ask yourself honestly what it is you want to get out of your relationship and how you can go about working to realize it without neglecting other areas.

The relationship could cause you some confusion and bring you to ask yourself if you are too selfish or if you have more of a tendency to neglect yourself. Possibly you dont understand your partners point of view and have to work on understanding the way his logic works.



There is a danger that you both find the relationship too complicated and prefer to criticize than to motivate each other with praise and recognition. You influence each others way of thinking, although the results arent very positive. The relationship has one advantage: you ponder the meaning of your life without painting everything in rosy colors. If you feel strongly about each other and want to stay together, it would make sense not to take on too many intellectual activities, maybe go dancing or participate in sportive activities instead. Take care of each other and make an effort to express yourselves clearly."

You dont have a tendency to worry a lot, preferring to take life easy, and you definitely know how to have a good time, but may overdo it, letting the relationship become shallow. Your challenge is to develop a certain depth and not skirt around serious topics. If you are honest with each other and avoid putting on an act to please your partner, you will be able to appreciate being accepted as you really are. Dont be afraid of opening yourself up because you can always count on your partner being understanding.



You may have a tendency to avoid every kind of conflict and to smile when you really feel like crying. At times like these you should remember that an argument doesnt necessarily mean the end of the relationship, in fact it often helps to clear things up."

Since you face the future with awareness and optimism, you will recognize your opportunities and take advantage of them. There shouldnt be any financial problems, it is more probable that you will acquire a small fortune together and never be in need. Even if you arent wealthy in the traditional sense, you will be satisfied with what you have.



Your intellectual development is still more important than the material level. In this area your partner may open your eyes and lead you to delve into many new areas of learning. Together you have the opportunity to expand your horizon to experience life and become more mature. What is especially wonderful is the interest you show in your partner, each of you feels secure and accepted by the other. Taking long trips to far off places will make the best use of this aspect"

988;KOMBIN_0000000001572866;The Sun in Conjunction with Saturn;"This aspect is very important in a Composite/Combine horoscope. It indicates that you will have important experiences together which will help you make progress, although there may be experiences which you greet less enthusiatically. You may discover character traits in yourself which arent easy to accept, or may feel in some way weak, vulnerable and oppressed. If this is actually the case you will find the strength to change the situation. This will also give you the self confidence you need to be able to share your life with someone in a relationship based on equality.



Possibly the stronger one of you will take charge and attempt to teach the other self discipline and order. At first you will be able to fight these restrictions, or feel as though your freedom were being taken from you. But you shouldnt allow yourself to react too soon, but first think about what the other is actually asking of you and consider whether it could be in your best interest to take the advice. If you end up playing this part, then try to keep your sponteneity and optimism to keep your partnership from becoming too serious."

This feeling of stability and continuity is important to both of you and you probably both do a lot to avoid disappointing the other and to be there for each other. You want to build a firmer foundation than other couples have, but you have to watch out that you dont intellectualize the partnership to the point of stifling the spontaneous expression of emotion. Because this is a harmonious aspect, no great problems are likely to arise, still a certain earnestness could get in the way of the relationships development and excitement. The best way to avoid this is to loosen up a little, overcome your skepticism and allow new fields of interest to capture your imagination as often as possible.



It is also important to give your partner enough room to make new experiences. Trust that he or she wont act contrary to your wishes, because of the deep feeling of responsibility. Professional endeavors should be successful as long as they are embedded in the traditional or conservative sector."

If your partner should ever be attacked, no matter from what direction its coming, getting involved and protecting him or her will earn you respect.

Nothing is the way past experience has taught you, which can have both positive as well as negative effects. It may be that you soon feel overwhelmed and long for things to be the way they were. The partnership could destabilize you so that you feel insecure and lack support. The relationship may change your whole life. It seems as if you cant count on anything any more; things change so quickly that it doesnt make any sense to make long term plans. Maybe you can get together and try out some of the things you have been thinking about, if you are able to overcome your inhibitions. Uranus represents your common energies at an intellectual level, which will ensure that your conversations will be stimulating and will inspire your imagination. But it wont be a stable relationship which you will be able to rely on. Stability would take a lot of effort and requires building on compensating aspects.



Possibly outside pressures may prevent your relationship from becoming stable and long-lasting. To overcome these difficulties refuse to let yourselves be pigeon holed and show enough courage to stand up to your relationships unusual character."

Basically it stands for a persons drive to express own individuality and still take part in a movement dedicated to progress and improvement and to overcoming barriers such as intolerance or established privileges. You will carry your efforts over into your relationship which should bring you to recognize during the course of your life that only truly equal relationships will be stimulating and make both people happy. Perhaps you are interested in spiritual subjects as many people in this age group are, and are part of the movement to bring about a new way of thinking. Your  intention may be to stop taking things out of the context and discussing minor problems, but to see the world and all lifes events as a unit to which each one of us can contribute something at any time. Other harmonious aspects may indicate that together with your partner you will make an effort to broaden your intellectual horizon, which may lead you to a kind of life which you would never have considered before.

Neptunes influence wont always allow reality to be seen clearly whereby drugs may be involved. This may also be the case in your relationship. Although you are full of good intentions and have high ideals, you may have difficulties practicing these ideals in every day life if you misjudge the situation. If you arent even aware of your own needs and weaknesses, how can you lead a happy relationship? Probably you want to achieve a lot all at once and have great ideas about living together, even if you sometimes forget that you and your partner are only human and need time for large changes.



You have to learn to differentiate between what is possible and reasonable to expect in a relationship, from that which is merely a product of your imagination resulting from childlike naivet. It would be better for you to confront problems one step at a time and master them than to plan great social reforms which only drive you farther away from reality. Another effect of this aspect could be that you imagine life together with this person will be completely different and not understand why no one around agrees with you. In this case you should listen to criticism and not disregard other peoples opinions as prejudiced or opportunistic."

You let yourself get distracted easily and are drawn to people who live unconventional lives and arent interested in knowing what will happen tomorrow.

Together you can generate a lot of energy and persuade others to join you, especially colleagues, because you can be very enthusiastic about projects, but that may change quickly.

Maybe you are isolated socially and suffer from a lack of understanding for your relationship, because you are unequal as a couple and place all traditional values in question. If you are determined to rise above other partnerships, then consider that your personal needs probably dont differ significantly from those of the majority.

Under these conditions you will help each other to reach your potential and will feel fortunate to have found the right counterpart. Just dont make the mistake of trying to prove yourself a hero who can free your partner from the deepest dilemmas, because there is a real danger."
1047;KOMBIN_0000000002359298;The Sun in Conjunction with Pluto;"This is a very powerful conjunction which wont go by without leaving its effects. Maybe your relationship wouldnt be considered ""harmonious"" in a classical sense, but still gives you energy which you would never be able to generate on your own. And no matter how great the crisis may be which you both have to go through, you will weather them out together. You have a talent for never giving up and come through every experience a little stronger. If you seriously intend to spend your lives together, no one will be able to prevent you. The partnership will teach you exactly where your strengths lie, but you will also be confronted with the unpleasant sides of your and your partners personality. The awareness will provide you with the opportunity to strive toward concrete improvements and, if problems arise, not to shirk your responsibility.



With this considerable potential, you have to treat each other with great care, always remaining aware of the consequences of your actions. When conflicts do arise, then they hit hard. At these times the partnership isnt something which can be treated as an afterthought. During the course of your relationship you will collect a lot of knowledge about your partner, which should be treated respectfully. Without additional indicators, it shouldnt be assumed that you will never use your energy negatively or abuse trust."

Try to treat each other with more sensitivity and dont withdraw as soon as you feel that you were misunderstood. Harmonizing the intellect and the emotions so that neither one is given priority over the other presents a challenge which wont be easy to live up to. The more important a certain area becomes, the more you will be pressed to make your partner understand your position. In this area you have to express your arguments clearly and convincingly. The only advantage this constellation presents is that you express your negative emotions immediately and the other is at least informed about them."

The relationship may be very emotional; because you want to share your inner life with your partner. You will get to know each other better and probably be happy together, which will depend on the remaining factors in your horoscope.



Your union is special, and is not easy for others to understand, although it makes you feel secure and at home. Possibly you will stay together under conditions which seem to indicate that it would be better to split up. The greatest challenge of this aspect is to recognize when the time has come to draw things to a close and concentrate on yourself, before you get too entangled in each other and start to deny your own identity."

Probably you arent on the same wavelength, which makes it difficult to find your way into your partners inner world and have intuitions which are orientated completely different. Because Saturn stands for stability, you could remain together a long time and try to solve this problem intellectually, by analyzing your feelings and bringing them in order. That could serve to clarify some things but wont bring warmth and closeness, because these qualities cant be produced at will. Additionally you could exercise subtle pressure on each other and coerce your partner to make certain emotional expressions or to proof each other's love, which promises to be even less successful.



If you dont have a romantic relationship, the effects of this square wont be so problematic, but can be felt in a deep sense of responsibility. Basically you should try to show as much sensitivity in emotional questions as possible and avoid making assumptions about the other based on yourself."

1145;KOMBIN_0000000002392130;The Moon in Square with Pluto;"Your relationship is very intense, but doesnt seem to have such a positive effect on you, because you could be animated to give into your lower instincts and load the atmosphere with jealousy or a desire to take possession of the other. You are very interested in the internal processes of your partner, but you could be susceptible to misuse the knowledge you have gained and subtly pressure and dominate others. The passion which breaks out could bring you to react too emotional and subjective, to lose control and cause harm to your partners soul. Naturally it depends on how far you have come in your development as an individual and whether you understand your own history, still you should be aware of the described dangers and try to be a little more careful with your partner.



The lesson for this square will be to respect your partners feelings and to judge events from the greatest possible distance. If you arent able to manage this, the consequences will be emotional and even subconscious entanglements which make the atmosphere of your relationship tense. Avoid developing a need to get down to your partners last secrets or to announce expectations which arise from your feeling of insecurity which no one can fulfill anyway."

Probably you will have an intense relationship because you both need to feel the security of the other and can assume that you arent together just for a short, superficial affair.

Even if this doesnt only bring harmony with it, you will respect each other deeply and draw meaningful conclusions from the journeys into your spiritual life.



This sextile will offer you a great opportunity to dig around in your deepest abyss and to leave things behind which have proven to be harmful to you.

1149;KOMBIN_0000000002359362;The Moon in Conjunction with Pluto;"This is a powerful and significant conjunction, which isnt always easy to overcome although it offers a lot of opportunities. Moving each other strongly, you both are active passionately from a personal and subjective point of view. Cool reason seems to have less influence than an undercurrent of emotion which always boils up and can almost force you to do things. Your partner can even stir you up inside until it becomes overwhelming and work each other up into a whirlwind of emotion and sudden needs which you cant handle. If you have kept your emotions in check in the past, this relationship will confuse you and may even bring you to doubt whether you are still the autonomous person you always thought you were. This experience will help you to express your emotions and to calculate the incalculable. 



It wont be a superficial relationship under any circumstances, rather it will come to an intensity that can work as a kind of cleansing process, if you dont give in to lower feelings or instincts and show jealousy. Try to deal with each other as freely as possible and not only carry out serious psychological examinations of your internal processes. A pleasant friction will build up which will supply warmth and could initiate some changes in your consciousness and your perception. No matter what kind of contact you have with each other: it will never be boring."

An atmosphere of warmth and trust should make you happy to show affection and take care of the other. Maybe you will react more emotional and instinctive than rational, but that shouldnt cause you any problems. Rather you should be happy to have found someone who makes you feel secure and who makes it easy for you to accept security. The effects of this sextile will be intensified if you have a family, whereby everyone will feel secure enough to talk about all their problems and will always find an open ear.



You like to decide intuitively and arent opposed to good arguments; which may result from Moon aspects under some circumstances. An additional advantage is that you treat each other tenderly and are quick to give in when there is an argument and are open for compromises. You wont put on an act for your partner, but will express your internal life as it is, which will help prevent conflicts from arising in the first place."

This could hinder you or confront you again with the same old problems you have already spent a lot of time dealing with. Memories of similar situations could surface and bring you to doubt your ability to turn over a new leaf and prove that you have made progress. This square will challenge you to let go of your past, to bring subconscious mechanisms to the surface and most importantly not to rely on your intuition too much, because it can lead you in the wrong direction. It is usually more effective to look at events from different perspectives.



Both of you need a lot of faith and affection in a partnership in order to open yourself and to honestly share your feelings with your partner. Maybe you expect too much and want someone to take the responsibility for your decisions. Generally your relationship may be less dynamic because the Moon has a more passive quality.

For this reason you can be sure that you wont have so many misunderstandings because you speak the same language and your thought processes run in a similar way.

You open yourself up to new areas of interest and consider things your partner is interested in without being judgmental. This could open new worlds before your spiritual eyes. The discussions are so stimulating that you dont get hung up on set ideas and keep your intellect flexible. This movement will keep your relationship more alive and not let you get stuck in routines.



You will start to question everything which you have believed in and maybe see things in a new light. The relationship should enable you to develop more understanding, recognize your alternatives and make use of your intellectual tolerance. If you plan business enterprises together, look for a field where you can be creative and make use of your creative ideas. Be careful not to exaggerate and dont force yourself to follow your ideas to their logical conclusion, otherwise you will get stuck in various actions. Your instability can have unpleasant consequences, still you should be able to make use of your natural lack of prejudice in order to go in new directions and to find individual solutions for yourself. You wont let yourself be pressed into a certain pattern. Everyone who has to get along with you has to take your inconsistencies into consideration. Sometimes you need a change of pace and should do something to make sure that you get it."

1203;KOMBIN_0000000002097282;Mercury in Conjunction with Neptune;"These two planets in your Composite/Combine horoscope provide an encounter between two completely different principles which can have very different effects. Neptunes mystifying and spiritual influence can contribute to a transformation in the communication and logic which Mercury stands for, whereby they are no longer characterized by reason, but by wishful thinking. This may make it difficult to express your opinion clearly. Managing day to day life could be made more difficult and confront you with completely new problems. There may be other reasons for you to try to keep your feet on the ground and to speak in a clear, understandable language which will not stir up more confusion. Also you are conducive to putting on an act in your relationship and avoiding unpleasant topics. Your intentions may be praiseworthy, but still you need concrete measures to establish your credibility and build a stable foundation.



If this side of the conjunction isnt problematic for you, you will develop an enviable understanding for each other. You dont necessarily use big words, but sense intuitively where your partner is headed and how it is to be understood. That will only be effective if you have a sense of reality and can estimate your partners strengths and weaknesses. Especially silent communication will contribute to the process of getting to know each other and will help you to find a consensus. Your consciousness is developing on a higher level, which makes you sensitive to the energies which you can sense in your relationship. This conjunction will be especially useful for art and creativity while it may prove to be a hindrance in business relations."

At least on a rational level you understand each other, you express yourself clearly, say what you think and, if you have joint finances, they will always be under control. You need both action and distraction, at least to feel like youre not missing out on anything. Mercury stands for short trips, which can be business related; maybe you travel together often. It wont get boring so quickly, you are interested in everything new and can approach new areas free of preconceptions and profit from the way others confront you with questions you havent asked yourself yet.



It is especially positive that you dont get hung up on your opinions and can recognize your mistakes. Your thinking and judgment can keep you mostly emotionally free, which is why you seem to treat each other pretty cool, although this impression wont stand up to a closer examination. Your attempts to be objective will make your life together easier and you prefer to accept the truth than to continue on in the wrong direction. This aspect is especially good for business relations."

Otherwise the relationship between giving and taking may not be balanced because one of you has your way at the cost of the other and may be building a career while the one at home inconspicuously takes care of the requirements of day to day life.



Probably you have a partnership which is fixed on traditional gender roles which will cause dissatisfaction in the long run. Your ideas about how a man or a woman should act are robbing you of opportunities to develop. You should learn to work on solving your every day problems together and to give your partner enough room to develop own wishes and to go after ambitions which have nothing to do with you.

When you are together you spread optimism, healthy self-confidence and openness which should make you happy to be together. You have strong feelings for each other which is why you give a lot of freedom and trust to each other."
1253;KOMBIN_0000000001589442;Venus in Opposition with Saturn;"Your exaggerated expectations may prevent you from creating a relaxed atmosphere with your partner which  encourages you to show your emotions without inhibitions. Especially if your relationship is based on emotions without coercion, you could have some problems to overcome which may result from overcautious behavior; You don't want to give up control and are afraid of losing your freedom in the relationship. Actually you have a great need for security and could be disposed to chain your partner to you. The relationship will restrict both of you and dependency or emotional entanglements will guarantee a great deal of pain when you separate.



Fears and inhibitions which you may have brought into this relationship with you, could make it difficult for you to enjoy sex with each other, because you express your passion only at times when you can be sure that your partner won't be responsive or you treat each other so roughly that the atmosphere is anything but erotic. It will be an important challenge for you to become clear about your own feelings which will enable you to express them to your partner without inhibitions and eventually experience love more spontaneously with no intellectual analysis. It isn't going to be easy, but when you start taking time, exchanging tenderness, with no expectations of perfection, just being together, then this could liberate you and allow you to loosen up in the relationship. For cooperation on a professional level this aspect isn't so problematic, it only means that you should take each other seriously and not put your trust at risk unnecessarily."

Happiness in your relationship will be dependent on whether you are in a position to express your feelings open and honestly, even if this should only occur in rare quiet moments. You could tend to stay in the relationship out of a feeling of obligation while losing sight of your partner's inner world. Make a concerted effort to break out of the routine and treat yourselves to something like a concert or a candlelight dinner. Seen positively you won't be in danger of departing from reality or losing the ability to see your partner critically. This is why you will be spared disappointments. Still this isn't just because you have inhibitions against taking risks. Business relationships should be satisfactory because you can combine aesthetics with your practical nature and could be successful at interior design or in similar areas."

The challenge is letting your feelings flow freely and giving to your partner without expecting certain behavior in return.

There could be problems especially in the area of erotic because Saturn could build up inhibitions which can't be dissolved without a lot of effort.



If you are patient and are able to give up some of your expectations of a perfect relationship, you will have a happy relationship. Just don't put yourself under pressure and see love with more composure so that it stays alive and offers room for further development.

You immerse yourself in emotions, are willing to give a lot, but may have too high ideals which can never be realized. Love has nothing to do with earthly life as far as you are concerned, but should stand above everything, whereby you shouldn't forget that no one can change as fast as they would like to. It would be better to activate your reason once and a while and to honestly ask yourself if you are capable of the behavior you expect from your partner.



Romance and tender hours for just the two of you are very important, although they may be at cost to your less important every day obligations. Even if you aren't opposed to avoiding them, passes time this negligence can grow into larger problems. Don't use love and the partnership to flee from reality or responsibility and don't imagine that you are dependent on one person or that she is dependent on you. You won't ever be anything but two independent individuals, who have to learn to get along on their own before they can have a happy relationship. It is important that you don't ignore unpleasant subjects, but honestly face them. If you don't take this advice serious, it could come to bitter disappointments which may hopefully eliminate your naivete."

You have the potential to be very happy together because Venus and Neptune both stand for love and understanding, which can bring you both to a higher level of selfawareness. Neptune symbolizes a striving to be detached from earthly needs and to follow spiritual ideas instead, this will let you see your attraction as something special, which you have never experienced before. Unfortunately you have an ability to see everything idealistically and may later be faced with bitter disappointments. You should examine whether you see your partner realistically or whether you are worshipping an illusion which no one can live up to.



Sex will probably play a subordinate role in your relationship. You are looking for a spiritual union and are apt to see the physical expression of love as ""primitive"". You would prefer to get your stream of emotions moving in order to harmonize them, eliminating contradictions so that nothing is left uncompleted, although this could lead to massive problems in daily life because you neglect less important obligations in order to concentrate on your partner. What is really wonderful is your ability to give selflessly and to do everything in your power to avoid disappointing your partner. Although you shouldn't forget that you still have to deal with human conditions. Don't expect anything supernatural, but be happy to have found a partner who stimulates your sensitive side and gives you a feeling for the intimacy people can share if they really want to."

Intensity and passion can confuse you thoroughly, but may also put some developments in motion. In any case this isn't just one aspect of your life among many.

You will have a deep friendship where you will share many wonderful experiences. Maybe your relationship is related to art, aesthetics in a broader sense or all kinds of pleasures. In any case it is under a favorable star which will bring out the best side in both of you and allows you to enjoy life together."

During the course of time you could both acquire assertiveness, which you will naturally show outside the relationship and which can be very useful to both of you. The only question remaining is whether the egotism which arises is a healthy variety. The relation would be better served by developing an ability to compromise and to refrain from behavior which will provoke aggression or irritation. If this is the case and you treat each other with increasing rudeness, it is about time to channel your excess energy and maybe to look for a challenge which you can work on together.



It would be beneficial if you found an area to work in, where you both can enjoy yourselves; sport would be an ideal way to test your physical potential and to let you earn a victory without first causing a conflict. Maybe you will be prevented from giving into your inclination to give your problems priority. It will be decisive if you are able to give in and leave some space for your partner's interests without feeling insulted. The relationship won't be happy until you learn not to take yourself too serious and to not always come down on the whoever is more self confident. Otherwise there could be a danger of making a bad impression or carrying your competitive thinking over into your circle of friends."

There is no reason to keep your ambitions modest, because no matter where you invest your energies you seem to be successful. You have a golden touch, but your successes come through hard work and you stand behind what you are doing a hundred percent. Generally you enjoy the fruits of your work more if you can share them with your partner and with others, because rather than concentrating on your own interests, you would like to use your energy to eliminate a few of the problems in the world today.



The mutual support which results in your plans being successful will give you confirmation that you can achieve a lot as long as you start out optimistically and keep your attention focused on the well being of everyone involved. In addition you can share a lot of fun in sexual activity due to your strong libido. Instead of reducing physical union to just sex, you want to use it to intensify your spiritual bond. Generally this conjunction is favorable for every kind of relationship, still you could draw more use from it, the more you do together. Both of you will find a suitable and natural means of self expression, which will strengthen your relationship and make you a wonderful partner. Realizing your ideas will seem easy with this partner at your side."

If you have old inhibitions, they will suddenly dissolve and make room for a change in the way you see yourself. You know what you want, and take ethical considerations into account while determining your ambitions. You are doing nothing out of pure egotism or at least are careful not to cause harm to anyone.

At first, you shouldn't set such ambitious goals but take smaller steps at first, this will help to avoid unnecessary set backs. With a self confidence which makes you feel capable of anything and everything, you can overlook any inhibitions and difficulties which may arise. This may also lead you to take action without being prepared for the actual circumstances. Basically, you should be able to work well together and generate positive energy, although you have to watch out that you take note of the fine points and at all costs avoid seeing your partner as a competitor. This attitude can motivate you to great achievements, but will eventually wear on the relationship to the point where you would prefer to part rather than to sincerely share your successes.



You consider the meaning of what you do, and therefore may be on the lookout for charitable causes and see your efforts in conjunction with the rest of humanity. It would do you a lot of good to take part in some physical activity together and let it serve as a vent for your excess drive and energy. Your mental state and your intentions will determine whether the advantages and good fortune associated with Jupiter will be at your disposal.

Your partnership won't run according to convention, but may be so unusual that it challenges your surroundings to protest. Both of you like to try out new things and tend to be quite autonomous. You stand behind your friends and the reaction of your environment to your behavior won't be of great interest. You have your own unpredictable will, don't like routines and want to experience things which not everyone would dare to do. The sexual attraction between you can cause confusion, and in extreme cases you won't even know what you are doing and what brought you together. Maybe everything went so fast that there wasn't any time left to think. For a certain period of time this ""over stimulation"" can put a lot in motion and motivate you to do unusual things, still soon it will become clear whether your relationship stands a real chance or not."

Probably you won't forget your own needs, although you see yourself as a part of the community which makes your contribution to every project especially valuable.



Sexuality will be very important to you and may provide an impulse for making changes. Maybe you have some extreme experiences in this respect before you since you feel strongly attracted to each other. The attraction is so great that you may be completely obsessed with each other for a time, which will do no harm.

In conflicts you could let all your masks fall and try to get in a good punch in any way possible. The problem is that you both want to have your way and enter compromises only reluctantly. It may be that you don't see yourself as being able to give in, but with a basic attitude which leads you to overemphasize your own needs and keep yourself from disappearing into the shadows.



Your relationship is dynamic and has a high energy level which you will have to use carefully if you want to put it to good use. The impulses you provide for each other could spur your drive to advance. If you see the relationship as nothing but a challenge where you have to prove yourself each day, it will quickly tire both of you. This square should be examined more closely to see if other horoscope factors can compensate for it, otherwise the atmosphere could be like that of an unending battle.

The tone between you can be somewhat aggressive, with conflicts arising more frequently until at some point neither of you will want to give in. You know what you can achieve and if you simply insist on getting your way long enough, it will only serve to intensify your egotism, which may make an estrangement unavoidable because neither of you is dependent on the other's assistance.

This attitude can be either positive or negative depending on its intensity: you will save yourself some disappointment if you can avoid plunging into doing things which you don't fully understand and act more reservedly, always doing your best to cover yourself. In extreme cases you could miss some good opportunities because you aren't open or confident enough to recognize and make use of them.

You will always be reasonable, although a little overconfidence at the right time can make the relationship more lively and more exciting.

In spite of this you will get along well; without making exaggerated demands and keeping yourselves content. An additional advantage of this conjunction is its tranquillity, especially if important decisions have to be made. You won't rush into anything or rely on luck, because you are convinced that everything has to be earned and even if you were to become rich one day, both of you will guard against throwing your money out the window, but will make intelligent investments, preferably in real estate.

The satisfaction and the perspective you find in this relationship are based on your basic attitude toward the most reasonable way for people to treat each other. And because you not only make an effort but can also admit to your own mistakes, you will be able to live out your intellectual potential in your every day life."
1371;KOMBIN_0000000001589570;Jupiter in Opposition with Saturn;"Your relationship to each other could leave you feeling very imbalanced and cause you to see your situation from one day to the next in completely different colors. You are either overly optimistic, oblivious to the most evident facts, or you see everything too pessimistically and shy away from changes out of fear of the uncertain. Maybe this constellation also means that you have very different attitudes toward life which may lead one of you to try to hold the other back, making him or her feel like being restricted. It would be positive if you were able to bring your opposing qualities into harmony and finally achieve realism which includes being able to take calculated risks. Still opposition aspects represent a challenge in the respect that the partner may have trouble unifying all the energies involved.



This opposition concerns the necessary qualities which exist in a state of infancy, such as the drive for expansion, an interest in new experiences and an optimistic attitude which combines Saturn's hesitation and inhibitions with the desire for consistency. Most likely you will need some time to build a foundation for trust, which will hopefully give you more freedom than you had at the beginning of the partnership. Both of you will have to be willing to give in, either to your partners need for security or the need to be unrestrained. If you arent willing to compromise, at least one of you will become dissatisfied over time."

Both of you are predisposed to decide spontaneously, which can make it impossible to build a basis for trust which you can both live with. Societal norms leave you both cold. You have your own ideas and dont let anything keep you from expressing your individuality in any situation. If you expect certain behavior from your partner or demand something which makes one or both of you feel restricted, it could lead to a separation. It would be better if you were to stay open for every development with as few preconceptions as possible. Your experience together could change your view of the world, although you will have to bring yourself to confront your partners ideas and attitudes. It may be that you have to make some agreements which may seem unusual for the character of your relationship. In any case you will have to grant each other every freedom and opportunity for development. If you dont find a way to do this, then you will have to separate because your own individual goals are apparently more important than the partnership.



Watch out not to provoke too much and do not show a lack of necessary sensitivity. You could be isolated because no one is able to deal with your unpredictable nature and your suggestions arent well thought out. Maybe you arent mature enough and dont find it necessary to do your part to contribute to the betterment of society instead of concentrating your attention on your ego. Less pleasant experiences in the relationship will bring you to take a closer look at the relationship and to realize what has to be done before you complain."

Neither of you should be dependent on the other, but find that sharing your lives with each other is more fulfilling. That's why you chose to stay together. There are no definitive rules between you, you both stay flexible and spontaneous so that situations will come up which you would never have thought about before. You need a certain excitement and change, which is guaranteed by your open and active lifestyle.



The relationship will bring about a change of mind. You wont just settle for the superficial. You want the things you do to be meaningful. Maybe you have a very unusual partnership, which others wont object to because you can relate its advantages well and others are in favor of your lifestyle. Possibly you have enough power to initiate social changes in your immediate surroundings and to convince others to free themselves from their self-imposed restrictions.

Think about whether you really accept your partners weaknesses and stand by when you are needed. You shouldnt resent your abilities but should be willing to learn from each other.



Maybe you are trying to keep each other under control and want to keep tabs on everything your partner does. You could have a tendency to see each other as competitors working against each other instead of admitting that your abilities are complementary. With a little cooperative effort you could realize your dreams. People around you will feel the influence of your charm, because you could try to use it to win friends for yourself and subtly turn them against your partner. The stress could cramp you up so much that it leaves you isolated. Consider whether you are ready to approach each other with good will and treat each other well.

In spite of this you could be very successful and achieve what you set out to do, however the question remains, whether that contributes to your happiness? But maybe you got into this partnership under the pretense of helping each other out and were prepared to take on certain roles from the beginning which are then tied to specific expectations. Think about whether you really accept your partners weaknesses and stand by when you are needed. You shouldnt resent your abilities but should be willing to learn from each other.



Maybe you are trying to keep each other under control and want to keep tabs on everything your partner does. You could have a tendency to see each other as competitors working against each other instead of admitting that your abilities are complementary. With a little cooperative effort you could realize your dreams. People around you will feel the influence of your charm, because you could try to use it to win friends for yourself and subtly turn them against your partner. The stress could cramp you up so much that it leaves you isolated. Consider whether you are ready to approach each other with good will and treat each other well. If that is the case, you can turn over a new leaf; you just need to be understanding and to relax a little in order to tune into your strengths instead of your weaknesses."

Jupiters qualities will help you see your relationship realistic and make sure that you dont get lost in the details. Probably you are making an honest effort to iron out your own weaknesses and look toward your partners strengths. During the course of your relationship you should be able to make a lot of progress and learn to trust in your abilities, instead of letting yourself be discouraged by your weaknesses. Your ideals will motivate you to do your best and to make your partnership more dynamic. Probably you will get rid of old ways of thinking and doing things, however, it will seem more like a natural than a painful process, because your positions arent inflexible and therefore open for new experiences.



The advantages of this trine will be more obvious when you start looking for something you can work on together which will challenge you. In addition to helping each other to bring out the best in yourselves; solidarity, healthy determination and sufficient confidence in each other will work to ensure your success. Possibly the effects of this aspect wont be limited to the two of you, because Pluto is also the planet of the masses, and in connection with Jupiter can put social changes in motion. This will at the very least influence the people in your immediate proximity and maybe even demonstrate how constructive change can bring about an improved quality of life. No matter what happens, you wont lose respect for each other and would prefer to part friends than to hold each other back and live a life lacking drive and motivation."

The other extreme would be that you freely believe that you have to give up every kind of individuality and never make a decision without your partner because you want to stay together.



Your job is to find a balance between these two extremes which will be satisfactory to you without merely burying the same old frustration below the surface. You shouldnt deny yourself anything, but must recognize how a life together differs from life as a single and at the very least let your partner know where he or she stands with you. If one of you wants to put the other under pressure and force him or her into doing things, your relationship will have no chance; however each of you should decide if you really want to have an equal and lively relationship and then act accordingly."

First a desire for stability and secondly you want to act on your ideas spontaneously. You will be able to give this relationship a stable foundation, where each can come to trust the other without being in danger of getting stuck in boring routines or rigid patterns of behavior. Each of you can motivate the other whenever it's necessary, hold the other back or express reservations about planned activities if the other should ever overdose on enthusiasm. If you want to, you will be able to come through everything together; both stamina and imagination will be available in abundance.



Although your attention is focused on the future, you will want to take some things from your past along; things you feel comfortable with and have come to trust, will bring about a sensible synthesis of old and new. Preferring to avoid risky enterprises, you do go in for smaller experiments, using them to analyze the situation. In spite of this positive starting point you should watch out that you arent going in several different directions at once and, if you do anyway, try to keep them in balance. Even if you arent doing everything together, each goes the way he or she thinks is best. If you are satisfied with an understanding of each other on the surface, there could be hidden tensions which may blow up without warning and have a shocking effect."

It seems that you have a strong need for security, while the other likes to try out everything that occurs to him. Your temperaments are very different, which almost guarantees problems. If you are the one who feels restricted and who isnt willing to live a life of indecision and compulsion, you will try various ways to break out or at least to ward off control mechanisms and rigid structures. Possibly you will never be able to make your partner happy, because he or she will never come to trust you and lives in constant fear of losing you. If the roles were handed out differently you wont be able to understand how anyone can be so unpredictable and inconsistent as your partner, who lives from one day to the next and is up for every surprise. You will probably try to work things out together, but the question remains, if you are really doing it sincerely. If important needs for both of you remain unfulfilled, it would be better to draw appropriate consequences. 



Maybe one of you is much older than the other, which may explain your differing attitudes toward life. The older one of you will have to find a lot of patience to keep yourself from denying your partner experiences which were important to you years ago. It will be important to you to talk about your needs and what youre thinking, so that unimportant events dont cause tensions to erupt suddenly without warning, as they sometimes do with Uranus. Your differences may complement each other and bring spontaneity and consistency into your life, what naturally depends on whether you are even willing to try."

You may ask yourself what you have in common and which goals you want to set for the future. Everything seems distorted and unclear, which could leave you feeling helpless, abandoned and frightened. You could be confronted with your own weaknesses which will give you the feeling that you arent as strong as you always thought you were and may be losing your confidence in your partners reliability. Your partnership has no recognizable structure, which doesnt necessarily mean that it is completely lacking structure.



This aspect can also be interpreted as an indication of a common foundation, whereby wishful thinking has priority over your sense of reality and you may have to deal with the bitter fact that you have been building on sand. Saturn-Neptune stands for experiences which are mostly unwelcome, but have to be endured whenever you refuse to face reality over a long period of time. Thereby you have the opportunity to change everything for the better and to continue the relationship under different conditions as mature individuals. Once you have overcome this obstacle you will be able to follow your dreams without neglecting your every day obligations. Your competence in combining the material with the spiritual is based on the recognition that the material demands are often exaggerated these days and take up space which could be put to better use by getting closer and becoming more loving and spiritual. This can extend to complete self sacrifice and asceticism. But its not necessary to exaggerate."

Keeping your consciousness and your dreams in harmony and appropriate to the situation can help you make detailed plans together and then let you be swept away in emotions. Your expectations arent about material values, you insist on an understanding and loving environment. Probably you have concrete ideas about how people should live together, but dont follow just this goal in your imagination; you are willing to go to court if need be and to work hard to make your dream a reality.



This aspect denotes more a platonic relationship, because Saturn symbolizes everything but sensuous pleasures and Neptune brings a tendency to de-emphasize the physical. That indicates that a sexual relationship wouldnt be very satisfying, unless other factors of the horoscope tell a different story. You will never have to work on yourself to give in or to grant your partner an advantage, because it is only natural for you to support the other as much as possible, which can be extreme in your case.

You could also have difficulty seeing both your role in the partnership and your partners personality realistic. It may lead to a deep insecurity about your abilities, your partners reliability or your common ground. You could start to lose self-esteem or blame yourself for events which occurred due to your differing personalities. One can assume that one of you is more pragmatic and puts the other under pressure which leaves him or her longing for more sensitivity as emphasis is placed on addressing the problems and demands presented in every day life. Actually you could complement each other well, because you can teach each other to keep your feet on the ground of reality as well as learning the value of unconditional faith. Certainly misunderstanding and frustration will arise; both of you will have to invest a lot of patience and understanding for your partners way of seeing things in order to get closer to each other.



At worst these conflicts could leave you feeling disappointed and depressed, although there isnt any obvious justification to feel this way at least not at this extreme. Instead of seeing differences as weaknesses, you should pay attention to what your partner is better at and build on your observations. No single aspect is capable of destroying a relationship if the couple really loves each other and wants to stay together, in spite of certain problems.

This is a very strong aspect which will leave its mark on your relationship and it is up to you whether you can relax and enjoy a lot of changes or put an end to the relationship, devastated by the stress. Probably you shouldnt measure your contact by conventional standards, it may be that you have never experienced a relationship in this form before. Neither of you are the type to look for security in the other, but prefer to lower your expectations on the other than to let yourself be trapped. Probably the intellectual level is more important to you than the emotional, both of you are relatively autonomous and could worry about losing your freedom if you get too close. The relationship wont be very stable, but could provide an impulse for important changes.

1448;KOMBIN_0000000009175554;Neptune in Conjunction with the Ascendant;"The relationship will bring out your sensitive side and let you experience things you have never been aware of. Both of you feel a need for complete devotion and to melt into the other. Maybe you will create a kind of mystical atmosphere which will attract people. This is a karmic aspect, which brings people together who have been searching for each other for a long time. For this reason soon after you have met, an intimacy will set in which will make it seem like you have always known each other, thus you will be able to understand each other without using a lot of words.



With Neptune there is always the danger of losing yourself and misunderstanding the truth because it gets lost in a stream of emotion. This makes illusion a threat to your relationship. Your chances of staying together over a long period of time will depend on your willingness to realize that your partner also has some attributes which are less attractive and in spite of your deep love, remain autonomous individuals. It may be difficult for you to make your own decisions and to avoid becoming dependent. Additionally you could be inclined to sacrifice yourself for each other and to suppress needs which dont fit into the picture. Both of you have an interest in accepting truth as a basis for living together. Then you will be able to share the wonder of love, more fulfilling than other couples are permitted to experience."

1468;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000002052;The Moon's Nodes - The Karmic Component - Where Do I Come From - Where Am I Going?;"The Moon's nodes are points where the moon's orbit around the Earth crosses the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The points are calculated and lie directly across from each other. When these two points are connected, the Moon Node Axis crosses the entire chart. It runs backwards, from Aries into Pisces, then into Aquarius, etc.



The Moon Node Axis can travel through the horoscope in 18.5 years, which leaves 1.5 years in each sign. The people our own age have their Moon Nodes in the same sign as we do, but not necessarily in the same house.



The rising Moon Node is referred to as the northern Moon Node or Dragon's Head. The falling Moon Node is called the southern Moon Node or Dragon's Tail. In Indian Astrology they are called Rahu and Ketu.



The meaning of the Moon Node Axis is tied closely to Karmic Astrology and is easier to understand in this context. It begins with a premonition that we are not on planet Earth for the first time, but that we have brought experiences from previous lives with us. In a horoscope the principle of reincarnation is described by the Moon Node Axis, whereby the falling Moon Node shows where the soul is coming from while the rising Moon Node describes where it is going to and our goals in this life. The Axis is the path we walk in this life. It can also be seen as a horoscope compressed into one line, which is expounded on by the remaining factors.



The rising Moon Node contains the sum of all the experiences from our past lives. This is why it seems more familiar to us than its complement. It represents all our favorite habits, which we cannot manage to free ourselves from, but which hamper our development, in other words our personal ""way of least resistance"". It is our duty to overcome our inner obstacles and pave the way for new experiences that go in a completely different direction, as we see on the opposing sign. We should endeavor to free ourselves from the chains of habit and look forward to unexplored harbors. The houses containing the Moon's Nodes tell us which areas we should further develop and where we are caught by transmitted behavior patterns.



One of the most interesting ways to see the personal horoscope is to look at how far we have come and then image what may lie in store for us."
1469;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000002049;Your Northern Moon Node in Aries;"Your task in this life is to become an independent individual with clearly defined opinions and to pursue your ambitions enthusiastically. Previously, you oriented yourself on your surroundings, striving for recognition from others. This explains why you were often uncertain about your own needs. You sacrificed your identity to a desire to be encompassed by harmony; this dependency made you exploitable. You became a master of compromises designed to synthesize everything into one mass. You probably have spent a lot of time in cultivated circles, well isolated from anything rough. You are used to being accepted by a group and react naively to approval; you are too uncritical of its source.



It is high time to make some changes. You may have to learn to push on with determination, not caring if others follow you or not. It is exceedingly important for you to establish an identity and take charge of your own life. Try to get over your dependency on other people's approval, be confident that your first step will not leave you isolated."
1470;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000018433;Your Northern Moon Node in Taurus;"This Moon Node position challenges you to stabilize your values during your lifetime and to overcome temptations to misuse power or let yourself be manipulated. Pay more attention to your mundane existence. Learn to respect other people's free will. This is especially important because people with weaker characters may find your aura of authority attractive.



Previously, you had difficulty controlling your drives and may even have been drawn to dark powers. You find yourself trapped in a web of dependencies and must first complete a process of transformation before you will be ready to devote another earthly existence to your education and development. Some dramatic experiences may have taught you to distrust the majority of people and to react defensively.



Use the earthy qualities of the sign Taurus and allow yourself the freedom to enjoy some of the less harmful pleasures in life. You have got to get control of yourself and to get back to the basics of human existence. If you can manage to invest your amazing powers solely in constructive endeavors, your experiences will teach you the true meaning of permanence."
1471;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000034817;Your Northern Moon Node in Gemini;"Previously you pretentiously assumed that your wisdom would bring the salvation of humanity and earn you historical recognition. You were even willing to bear every frustration, as well as isolation after each and every friend turned away from you. Convinced that you were capable of receiving enlightenment in passing, you never stopped to consider or even to listen to the opinions of others. Any criticism on your intellectual creations was immediately taken as a personal affront. All in all your unbridled arrogance has become your greatest trap.



It is extremely difficult to find a way to break such a pattern of behavior. More contact and more communication with others will help you to see things from the other side and recognize other facets of the truth. True involvement in your community will depend on your learning to value restraint and tolerance. This will also involve exchanging your fear of losing your prized independence for an understanding of the value of bonding with other people."
1472;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000051201;Your Northern Moon Node in Cancer;"This incarnation will give you the opportunity to learn to express your feelings freely and to allow other people to get close to you, especially your own family. Earlier you remained icily distant from everyone around you, rigid in your high social standing. You also tended to judge people by their status. Spontaneity and natural joy were foreign concepts to you, lost in your ambitions to redeem the respect you felt worthy of. You would go to any lengths to achieve your goals even if it involved infringing on the needs of those around you. You were a loner even in the company of others.



This could all change if you would only give up your activities in the community and dedicate yourself to giving back to your family and showing a little appreciation for the support you have received from them. Take some real responsibility for those around you without asking what is in it for you. You will develop imagination and sensitivity and finally bring an end to your spiritual isolation. Once you have overcome your false pride and self-righteousness you will be capable of loving life and emotional involvement."
1473;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000067585;Your Northern Moon Node in Leo;"You know how it feels to work towards common goals in a large group. In spite of your unconventional ways, experience has convinced you that constant activity in your circle of friends or in a large group is the most efficient way to get things done.



In the past you had only little time for your private affairs and were also hesitant if not even a little bit afraid to work toward realizing your own individual goals. You usually stayed focused on the interests of all humanity and perform altruistic service while maintaining emotional distance. Unfortunately, you also tended to waste a lot of energy because your goals were not clearly defined.



Now is the time to become more concrete and separate from the masses. Your new experiences will lead you to attain independence and allow your individuality to surface. To achieve success, break away from the crowd and go your own way. You will eventually be recognized for your efforts by people willing to follow you. In time you will discover pragmatism and fairness and how to make use of them. Even if you work to realize your private ambitions, it will not necessarily have a less positive effect on your environment as your unyielding attempts to alter society."
1474;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000083969;Your Northern Moon Node in Virgo;"This Moon Node position challenges you to make clear, rational decisions taking leave of your emotional martyrdom. You are held captive by illusions and allow yourself to be caught up in tragic tales. You cannot express your position in front of others because you are very seldom capable of recognizing what your positions actually are. These veils of uncontrolled emotionality often lead to exploitation, leaving you unable to defend yourself. Resolution and ambition were alien concepts. Having closed your eyes to reality, you could not understand the cause of your suffering. Your being was unattainable and your self-pity only added to your isolation. Lack of self-confidence and your willingness to allow emotions to control your ideas inhibited your development. 



You are going to have to find a way out of this behavior pattern. You cannot run from the truth, even if it is not always pleasant. Do not let yourself be swayed by other people's moods. Practice saying no to yourself and to those asking for favors. You have to learn to think critically and to define your goals clearly if you ever want to reach them. Analyze the situation in order to differentiate between pity and sympathy. If you want to help then go to a hospital or similar institution and offer concrete help to people who really need it."
1475;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000100353;Your Northern Moon Node in Libra;"Your task in this life is to learn to live with other people and to show consideration for their needs. You became used to unceasingly pushing your way through. You stumble through life oblivious to the consequences, accompanied by the feeling that you are being shortchanged or are missing out on something. You can hurt others with your thoughtlessness without even being aware that you are doing it. Your lack of sensitivity makes you seem cruel and prevents others from developing interest in you beyond staring at you in amazement. Your lack of restraint in expressing aggression makes life with you difficult, as does your tendency to think that someone will take something away from you if you do not make a grab for it first.



Now you have the chance to recognize what you have been doing and rethink your behavior. You should try to be more quiet and take time to listen to others and reflect. You should maintain balance between your own needs and those of others. Learn to make compromises and do not always think that your interests are being sacrificed. If you wait and watch you might see that someone else would like to have that last piece of cake, you will be amazed at how much you can achieve without even having to fight for it."
1476;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000116737;Your Northern Moon Node in Scorpio;"Previously you were attached to your possessions and material successes and had no concern for your spiritual development. Work was hard and persistent leaving you prone to rest after receiving your reward. A decadent lifestyle and preoccupation with your own physical comfort kept you from seeing other more important values. You were not interested in becoming enlightened, but were happy to be made a slave to wealth. All change was painstakingly avoided, because the risk of losing something seemed high enough to prevent you from even trying to overcome your inertia. You were satisfied to keep all your routines, suspiciously watching anything unfamiliar.



Your task is to learn to accept the flow of change and to prepare a comprehensive spiritual transformation. Open yourself to new experiences and learn to be detached if you want to profit from life's lessons. If you do not comply voluntarily, circumstances may eventually force you into it.



Earthly existence is an adventure, in which winning always implies some risk. Extreme situations will reveal your strengths and help you to develop abilities that will prove to be effective. Newly acquired free space will allow your energies to unfold and reach their full potential."
1477;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000133121;Your Northern Moon Node in Sagittarius;"Your task in this life is to overcome your indecisiveness and take a firm standpoint. Before, you approached strangers and freely exchanged ideas with them. The problem arose when you tended to let yourself be convinced too easily, and ended up repeating what was being said to you in order to gain approval. That was no problem for you because you were unable to establish a personal relationship to the contents of the conversation. Thus you earned a reputation for being superficial, never taking anything seriously. You suffered from your own inner conflicts and your ability to see everything from every perspective. Frequently, you had no idea what you actually wanted, searching for your own well being in a multitude of activities. Still you were unable to commit yourself, always choosing to remain on the sidelines.



Now is the time to begin your search for truth. Silence is preferable to joining a discussion with an offhand comment that you may regret later. If you want to gain deeper insights, you are going to have to be more honest with people. It may be necessary to withdraw for a while until you have found yourself. Expand your horizons and do not be satisfied to occupy yourself with trivialities. Better alternatives would be to take a long trip or to study sophisticated literature. You will learn your lessons and develop firm opinions through patience and determined effort."
1478;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000149505;Your Northern Moon Node in Capricorn;"Your challenge in this life is to attain maturity and responsibility, leaving childlike behavior behind. Your moods have been making it impossible for others to figure you out, especially with your stubborn refusal to exchange the weaknesses you have acquired for more resolute and reasonable behavior. You have been prone to twist the truth to suit your needs and then become furious when things went differently than you expected. Because you are barely getting by on your own, you are inclined to put your fate in the hands of stronger people who are willing to look after you. You have a tendency to be obstinate in defiance of every logic, which only hurts you. The fear of retaliation for your behavior has kept you from going out. You much prefer to throw a fit in the privacy of your own home. You wished that everything would return to the way it was.



The time for change has come. You are challenged to find a place in society and take yourself seriously. Go out and confront yourself with the consequences of your behavior; this will in turn force you to act more reasonably. You have to recognize that there are more important things than your personal insignificant affairs and that important duties await you. You can no longer evade your responsibility. You are asked to take it on lightheartedly, as no one can relieve you."
1479;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000165889;Your Northern Moon Node in Aquarius;"In the past you have managed to place your own interests in the center of every activity, disregarding the rest of the world. You insisted on setting the pace and were unable to let yourself be led by anyone else and inept at cooperation among equals. Your lust for power and excessive pride let you forget how much real friendship could give you and how wonderful life within a community can be. Your conceit led you to find a role in any drama that would make you the center of attention. You were not even able to admit to the same weaknesses in yourself, which you despised in others.



Now you are called upon to sacrifice your own personal goals to service for your community. Descend from your pedestal and meet with the ""lesser"" folk. You could learn more than you dare to imagine. Your duty is to devote your managerial qualities to the development of a more humane society and subdue your ego in support of a nobler goal. This will require letting your mask fall as well resisting the temptation to dominate others. You must learn to think of yourself as a small part of the universe, which can attain its destiny only through a cooperative effort with friends and partners. Any attempts to resist may result in an involuntary isolation that will eventually force you into taking these very steps."
1480;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000182273;Your Northern Moon Node in Pisces;"The lesson for this life is to become less stubborn and open yourself for spiritual development in order to feel sincere sympathy for others. 



This could be complicated by the fact that you have made a habit of living by strict rules. It would be better to reexamine the rules critically before accepting them as a standard. Order and duty determine your life to a large extent. Even when helping someone, it is out of a sense of duty, because such things are expected. Your innate distrust should help you to avoid the dangers of this world, but at the same time it cancels out sincerity and the ability to love. You want everything to be explainable and easily within reach. A consciousness that extends beyond the limits of your sensory perception is beyond imagining.



Events of this life have been constructed to prove that you can increase your sensibility. Some trust in your intuition and a little dedication could open new worlds and grant you access to the inner processes of the people around you. If you open yourself up and loosen the rigid structures within you, the reward will be the ability to recognize the oneness of the universe and to offer love and sympathy for all the inhabitants of the Earth."
1481;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000002054;Your Northern Moon Node in the First House;With a rising moon node in the first house, you should start searching for your identity and your personal strengths. Do not fall into the old habit of relying on approval from your partner, but encourage your own strengths. Exercising solidarity in the realization of your goals is not the point. Rather, you are asked to achieve independence through a confident appearance and to live according to your needs. Even if you still put yourself under pressure to become one with your partner, take the initiative and accept the challenge of self-fulfillment. If you should want to have another relationship, you will be able to contribute more without running the risk of being used.
1482;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000018438;Your Northern Moon Node in the Second House;Instead of living at the expense of others, floating in strange worlds with no connection to reality, as in the past, base your life on a firm foundation. Turn the suppressed drive for destruction deep within you, into positive energy that can be used to restructure the environment. Fulfilling your karma will require work in all areas. It is important for you to see tangible results. Otherwise your jealousy of other people's success will only make your life more difficult. Be willing to work long and hard for a comfortable home and work responsibly. Under no circumstances let yourself be seduced to use your influence over people to profit from their energy or let your spiritual powers make you arrogant. Be humble and recognize the worth of hard-earned success.
1483;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000034822;Your Northern Moon Node in the Third House;"Think about how you get along with the people around you. Do not allow yourself to become distant with friends, neighbors and family, especially brothers and sisters, and do not give in to the temptation to lose yourself in long-winded theoretical explanations. The challenge is to communicate on an everyday level and present your knowledge in a way that can be utilized. Do not believe that you are intellectually superior to others, but be willing to consider their ideas and suggestions.



In relationships, your need for freedom gives you a feeling of being chained or even oppressed before very long. It is important to be able to find workable compromises to reconcile your concept of freedom with the needs of your partner. Get down to the fundamentals of spiritual reality; do not let anyone convince you that spiritual development is only possible in distant places."
1484;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000051206;Your Northern Moon Node in the Fourth House;Now is the time to break with public life and return to your home and family. Look for happiness within yourself. Be assured that no social status can ever give you as much satisfaction. Open yourself to others and let them know what is going on with you. If you can overcome your stubbornness and embittered determination you will be richly rewarded with the sincere warmth of the people you love. Your family has needs beyond stability and a firm financial basis, but also love, sympathy and openness. Be tolerant of human weaknesses and do not always try to be a rock of stability for everyone around you. Give in to the flow of life with all of its changes and do not try to set positions for all eternity.
1485;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000067590;Your Northern Moon Node in the Fifth House;"Primary development in this lifetime should be concentrated in personal areas. Follow your heart and work for your private interests instead of future-oriented, collective enterprises. These days, great ideas do not count as much as their realization. Large crowds of people are not what it is all about, what you need are friends who mean something to you. Your imagination should enable you to spend contented hours in romantic relationships as well as live out your moods erotically. With your childlike character, you are probably good with children and prefer any fantasy world to reality. This is why you should learn to think realistically.



Sometimes you feel torn between doing something for yourself and helping others. You will learn that this does not necessarily imply a contradiction, if you remain sincere."
1486;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000083974;Your Northern Moon Node in the Sixth House;"Now is the time to structure your life. Concrete activities will distract you from depressive thoughts. If you have problems, do not resort to self-pity, but search for practicable solutions, if necessary ask your friends for help.



Do not shy away from taking on responsibility in order to serve humanity better. Thoroughness and responsibility may not sound very appealing, but it is important for you to fulfill your everyday routines consequently, and so avoid creating chaos. Your sensitivity keeps you from maintaining distance and following logical conclusions. On the other hand, you have the capacity for spiritual development once you detach yourself from the past and recognize the real opportunity that this incarnation offers."
1487;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000100358;Your Northern Moon Node in the Seventh House;"The challenge of this life will crop up in your relationships; this is supposed to teach you to recognize the needs of others. Learn to understand the effects of your behavior and accept some dependency on your partner, if you want to be happy. Consideration and the ability to cooperate probably are not your primary strengths, but they are absolutely essential to a loving relationship. This does not imply that you are expected to act selflessly. The goal is to find a balance between independence and partnership which both can accept. It is also important to develop more endurance when it comes to investing in a relationship and not to throw everything overboard at the first conflict. You will see that warmth and trust grow slowly and that accepting minor inconveniences pays off in the long run."
1488;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000116742;Your Northern Moon Node in the Eighth House;"In this lifetime, you should become detached from material possessions and develop self-confidence. In this context, Death, which is associated with the eighth house, signifies letting useless patterns of behavior die off that are hindering your progress. The point is to let go of the security you have come to love and build up enough courage to set out in new directions and expose yourself new and different experiences. Look for extreme situations where you can discover your true self and overcome your inflated possessiveness. Subdue the obstinacy you developed in the past or you can count on an escalation of the conflicts you will have to face.



Especially in the area of sexuality, you will recognize that giving yourself completely to emotional experiences can lead to transformations. Let your instinct be your guide and you will discover immense energy deep within your being."
1489;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000133126;Your Northern Moon Node in the Ninth House;"Start searching for the meaning of the experiences you have encountered and set your goals high. Your insatiable thirst for knowledge may prove itself to be more of a hindrance than help because you tend to lose yourself in details and waste energy on mundane affairs. Do not get confused by thousands of individual pieces, but try to recognize the overall picture and its connections.



Expand your horizons and fervently work to realize your ambitions. A sense of justice and love of truth will accompany you on your way. You have the potential to attain complete intellectual freedom and to be rid off the feeling of dependency on your community. Withstand the pressure to turn your mind into a portable library filled with facts; do not ignore the voice of your heart while making decisions. If you succeed you will have the opportunity to share your insights with others."
1490;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000149510;Your Northern Moon Node in the Tenth House;Personal problems and responsibilities can make it difficult for you to advance your development and attain an appropriate position in society. Recognition is especially important for you. Do not limit yourself to everyday household concerns. Take on responsibility in your community and develop your strengths by working on your career responsibly and with dedication. Think about how much energy you want to invest in your private affairs and consider the meaning of self-reliance and financial independence. Once you have achieved your goal of maturity and getting in control, you will figure out how to combine the two areas. You will be able to channel your emotions and offer practical solutions to household problems.
1491;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000165894;Your Northern Moon Node in the Eleventh House;"You still perceive the events around you from a very personal perspective. It is difficult for you to develop objectivity and to submit your strong will to common goals.



However, this is exactly the problem at hand. Try getting lost in a crowd to practice getting along in a large group of people. Put your inflated pride in your uniqueness aside and think about what you could do for others. Follow your individual goals if you want to avoid continuous confrontation with the same problems. Your ego will not do you any service in this life, but has to be overcome in order to free your strengths and imagination for service to the community. Use your power of reason and avoid the distractions offered by romantic adventures that only serve to boost your self-confidence. You will then find that you can be very happy among your friends."
1492;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000182278;Your Northern Moon Node in the Twelfth House;The past was probably so difficult because your exaggerated expectations and perfectionism prevented you from achieving satisfaction. Withdraw for a period of physical relaxation and take a trip within yourself. Draw your attention away from mundane activities and overcome your preoccupation with details in order to concentrate on a search for inner peace. You are still attached to material possessions and refuse to rely on anything but cold logic. You see disorder and deficiencies everywhere, which upsets you and distracts you from the important things in life. If you do not change, illness or isolation will probably force you to rest and to take a deep look within yourself. Find a way to rejuvenate and address your surroundings with loving criticism, if you want to learn your lesson and finally experience inner wealth.
1493;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000002180;The Part of Fortune - Your Personal Key for True Contentedness;"Everyone asks themselves once in a while what they can do to be happy and finding an answer to this question is not as easy as it may seem, because many people have wrong impressions about their real needs. They might be convinced that they need something, are oriented on inappropriate role models or let themselves be influenced by other people's ideas while possibly they are already on the wrong path. Usually they are not aware of it until it is too late. If you know how to make someone really happy, usually you are prepared to make an effort or to make difficult decisions. This makes the Part of Fortune something like a personal code of ethics, which has to be remembered in every circumstance. It is one of the sensitive points and is derived from Arabic Astrology.



The Part of Fortune is calculated by subtracting the Sun position from the Ascendant position. We add the number of degrees of the moon to this result. A simple formula would look like the following:

Part of Fortune = Ascendant - Sun + Moon



The position of the Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant are not randomly used for calculating the Part of Fortune. It is based on the consideration that the energy of these three bodies are what characterize people and gives them their individual personalities:  The Sun as the symbol of identity and ambition, the Moon for its emotionality and its conscious and subconscious reactions, and finally the Ascendant as the visible personality, which expresses the energies of the Sun and the Moon. The position in the horoscope where Sun, Moon and Ascendant are most harmoniously working together is called the Part of Fortune. The energies of a sign and the affairs of the astrological house concerned will show you how to reach a state of true happiness."
1494;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000002177;Your Part of Fortune in Aries;"In order to experience long-lasting happiness, simply discover the world again and again as you follow your spirit of adventure, which does not necessarily have to involve travel. Everyday life should be exciting and filled with variety; you would not know what to do with peace and quiet anyway.  Challenges provide an opportunity to prove your strength and courage, and you look for them everywhere. Knowing that your personal successes were created on your own provides you with satisfaction at least for a short time; by then new challenges will have presented themselves, especially in the areas presented by the house where your Part of Fortune is found. The prerequisites of happiness are being active and doing something instead of making complicated plans, but most of all spontaneeity.



Your environment should not suffer from the way you concentrate on yourself when you work; although you may feel independent, you still need companionship. Additionally, getting to know people who are not afraid to say what is on their minds will provide you with new motivation."
1495;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000018561;Your Part of Fortune in Taurus;"In this world where everything is rapidly changing, you need something to hold onto to make you happy. You are also looking for lasting values, either of a material or spiritual nature. A relatively large need for security makes you always want to include the momentary circumstances of your life in your plans. Probably it will give you a deep sense of satisfaction to look back and see what you have accomplished in your lifetime, whether it is a business, a house or a loyal family, where mutual support is assured. This will form a foundation from which you can work, taking all the possible turns of events into consideration so that you will not be unpleasantly surprised. Probably you make a lot of effort to make sure that things develop according to your plan. It makes you feel good to make materials useful and to give things form and structure.



Try to avoid complicated relationships, unnatural behavior or a sophisticated lifestyle; you thrive on simplicity in everything and a natural environment. That applies especially to interpersonal relationships where it is important for you to know where you stand. Playing with fire does not appeal to you, it is more important to be able to place trust in certain people than to surround yourself with a large group of people who are fun to be with but who do not really know each other. Your partner should be someone you can lean on, who you can pamper with your sense of romance. This ties sexuality closely to love and intimacy."
1496;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000034945;Your Part of Fortune in Gemini;"To you life means always adjusting to new circumstances and observing them out of varying perspectives. You need movement, intellectual challenges and to be surrounded by people who constantly provide you with new insights. This is why you need to communicate, keep yourself well informed and think about everything that is important to your existence and society. You are happy when you can communicate, discover interesting fields or analyze situations. Maybe you are not very adept at understanding the emotional side of people, but have no problem following their way of thinking.



It may sound paradox, but you like to be in the center of things without being so intimately involved that you cannot easily withdraw at any time. Your consciousness of reality tells you that it is not very useful to place a lot of importance on something you have no control over, and so you are often the observer who draws conclusions which make everything a little clearer without putting you in danger of being hurt. You feel intimacy not through emotional but through spiritual closeness, which is why your partner can only make you happy by creating an atmosphere in which interesting and practical conversations are possible."
1497;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000051329;Your Part of Fortune in Cancer;"The energy of Cancer expresses itself most clearly in the wish to actively participate in decision processes that serve to improve the feeling of community.  This could be contributing an idea, organizing a project, taking care of a garden or even, which would certainly be the most intense, the birth of a child. These kinds of activities make you feel that you are part of the community and let you know where your place is, which is also something you need for your happiness.



Still you will have to overcome a barrier - your doubts about you doing the right thing with your life, whether you can trust certain people or if everything will turn out badly. Basically, it is all about overcoming fear in order to enjoy life with all its surprises. Then you will be able to help bring about changes and exercise a certain amount of influence, although you have to become aware of it first. Once you have overcome your fears and have faith, you will be pleased to devote yourself, especially to making your family happy. Knowing that you are needed and then creating a warm atmosphere where love, understanding and a feeling of belonging can grow will make you very happy.



If you have problems overcoming your doubts and showing the people closest to you how you really feel, it would make sense to think about your relationship to your parents and try to find the source of your insecurity. Also, you should always defend your private sphere, especially if your professional life is strenuous."
1498;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000067713;Your Part of Fortune in Leo;"Because you need the recognition of your community to be happy, you are willing to do a lot to make sure that no doubts about your integrity arise. Your high expectations of yourself due to your convictions about morality and respectability make you unwilling to compromise, although generally you can be very tolerant, as long as others leave room for your individuality. Always trying to give your best and to be a good example is an expression of your need to be respected by the community. This kind of self-motivation will help you to develop a strong personality during the course of your life. You will have the intellectual strength to overcome your subjective viewpoint and offer support to others, whereas you only seldom accept help from others. You need to feel proud of yourself and of the things you have accomplished; without knowing that you have overcome great hurdles and really ""kicked ass"", you can never be happy. You are not able to enjoy rewards that you have not earned honestly



It is important to you to have enough room to put all of your creative energy to use; you simply need space which you can organize in your own way, whether it is at work, in your free time or within the family. No matter how determined you seem to be, you need to know where you stand. Because respect is a prerequisite for happiness you are always trying to get feedback from others."
1499;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000084097;Your Part of Fortune in Virgo;"Happiness depends on knowing that you are in control of everything you do and of your entire life. Your perception of existence is primarily oriented to tangible things which can be explained, you are not interested in mysteries. You want to deal with situations with clear facts, which is why you are happy to ""clean up"" in any sense of the word. People whose motivations you cannot identify or who lead unstable lives are not your type, unless they are trying to get their lives back on the right track. In cases like these you should keep your distance and not make the mistake of confusing other people's needs with your own.



It is easy for you to stay in the here and now. You have no fear of reality as long as you can recognize your options. Every victory of reason makes you happy because you will always work to stay on top of things and find reasonable pragmatic solutions."
1500;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000100481;Your Part of Fortune in Libra;"It makes you happy to work on your relationships until you feel that you are being well taken care of. This allows you to devote your entire potential to your popularity without having to force yourself to do so. Mostly you want to avoid feeling alone and do everything you can to be accepted by your community.  You back off from your position instead of trying to convince the majority to see things your way, you work to maintain harmony in your surroundings and try to unravel complicated situations. Shared experiences, especially with your partner, are very important to you, but when you are alone you do not feel like doing much. 



You always want to feel welcome everywhere you go and avoid imposing yourself under any circumstances. It is not necessary to fight or to strain yourself in order to be proud of your successes; you prefer things to stay tranquil and uneventful. It is enough for you to say that you could achieve anything you set your mind to. Possibly you participate in other people's experiences so intensively that you do not have to do much on your own and lead a more peaceful life this way, which is fine with you."
1501;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000116865;Your Part of Fortune in Scorpio;"Probably you are not searching as much for happiness as to find a confirmation that your perception of life, seeing everything as transient, is correct. In your search for challenges and extreme experiences in order to get to know yourself, you outdo even the most daring. Each time you test your limits and are able to push them back still further fills you with joy. On a physical level, sexuality plays a large role in your life.  You thoroughly enjoy the purest life energy that lets people know where they came from, which, of course, is nature, although you do not neglect the other side of being human and are always in search of truth and spirituality. The meaning of existence, the essence of evolution and human development interest you in such a way that you like to track things down and get behind mysteries.



Being conscious of transience and the inevitability of death could even have a calming effect on you and give you courage to test how far your fighting instinct and your will power will take you. Basically, you want to use your entire potential and experience life as intensely as possible."
1502;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000133249;Your Part of Fortune in Sagittarius;"Probably you are naturally content without being aware of its value. It is part of your personality to believe in the future and in the good in people and this attitude will be rewarded. Positive thinking will give you strength to take life easy without becoming superficial. Feeling unstrained may be one prerequisite for your happiness.  Freedom is something precious that you could never give up. When you obligate yourself then it is voluntary and with consciousness. 



There is a lot of natural self-confidence in you and it is enough for you to enjoy life, discovering some meaning beyond this is not a priority for you. Telling the truth and acting on it, being authentic is more important to you; you would not be able to live with yourself if you did otherwise. Another quality that you appreciate is your spontaneity. Anyone who tries to keep you from going on adventures or letting your enthusiasm show will not be your friend for very long. Otherwise, you do your best to get along with everyone, which contributes to your popularity as well as your general happiness."
1503;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000149633;Your Part of Fortune in Capricorn;"For you happiness means the satisfaction of knowing that you have accomplished something in your life and have put your talents to effective use. Seeing how your plans are realized and take shape, how things move into the right place and proceed as they should makes you happy. Your goal is to apply what you have learned usefully and to draw as much as possible out of your experiences. In your surroundings things should be determined by reason, probably because you sense instinctively that becoming too emotional could be dangerous and might interfere with your progress.



A desire to contribute your part and be a recognized member of society, maybe even social climbing, explains why you prefer to rely on your own accomplishments; probably you never want to be dependent on accepting assistance because you could not reconcile that with your image. Aging holds no fear for you because you associate it with maturity, which can only be useful to your plans. On the other hand, you see youth as more of a handicap, of not being taken seriously by society."
1504;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000166017;Your Part of Fortune in Aquarius;"The prerequisite for your happiness is having enough freedom to stand behind your ideals without making compromises. Friendship is more important to you than a romantic relationship where each places expectations on the other. What you need is room to experiment, the company of people with similar convictions and critical attitude toward social norms. Recognizing that you are living as an individual in a group and that potential can be magnified are important experiences that will motivate you to fight for equality and against prejudices of every kind.



Belief in the future is something you have in common with those whose Part of Fortune is in Sagittarius, because you believe that humanity will find solutions to the present problems. Basically you have a lot of understanding for the weaknesses of our species, so that you seldom react furiously but usually have an explanation at hand. You are by no means indifferent to development, still you need a certain emotional distance to things, because Aquarius is an air sign and therefore has an intellectual emphasis. Do not let yourself be pressured into acting hypocritically, which in the end will only stand in the way of true harmony.  You need your freedom, which you are also willing to grant others."
1505;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000182401;Your Part of Fortune in Pisces;"Pisces is the most spiritual sign of the Zodiac and represents universal love and sympathy. This is why your happiness depends on not placing more emphasis on yourself than on each person around you. An exaggerated or exclusive occupation with the factual reality of every day life could distract you from making use of your limitless imagination and the recognition of your true needs, namely overcoming your own ego and conforming to the natural flow of life. The victories you have fought for will not make you happy, although knowing that you can attain detachment and not be trapped in earthly struggles will. Happiness will come when you succeed in accepting life with all of its joys and sorrows, without long-term rigid plans which create the illusion of power and are not likely to work out anyway, leaving you feeling dissatisfied.



You should work on your inner stability and try to do more for others than for yourself. Work on getting to the root of your emotions and see yourself in relation to the whole world. Your potential for establishing a deep feeling of being connected to every living thing will never leave you feeling lonely and will make you happy."
1506;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000002182;Your Part of Fortune in the First House;"Having this constellation in your chart you will find fulfillment by going your own way and finding the courage to free yourself from other people's opinions and society's moralistic standards. Success will come from relying on yourself acting according to your personal way of seeing things, which may be out of the ordinary. In the course of your life you will make your mark on society while remaining true to yourself in spite of any controversy which may arise around you. Additionally, you want to be appreciated for your uniqueness; when someone thinks they can go over your head or insist on comparing you with normal citizens, that is something you cannot deal with and feel challenged to prove the opposite. Then at the very least you take the liberty of doing and saying what you really think at the time, just to make sure that there is something going on. Probably you are not well known for being considerate, and at times it may be difficult to convince you that there are factors other than your interests that must also be considered. Still, subjectivity and your way of concentrating on yourself should give you the necessary drive to work on projects you find interesting. You could become the leader of a new movement, which will most likely be something unusual.



It often does not make any difference to you if you are isolated by your actions or if others just do not understand you. It would make you unhappy if something would keep you away from following your instincts or placing restrictions on the essence of your being and your lifestyle. It would be more to your liking if you could, just once, take off with an idea without long contemplation and tedious planning. It would even be a distraction for you if you were to get involved with the community or notice other people's reactions. On the other hand you certainly do not want to risk getting a reputation for being too strange or too incompetent to stand up and take command.



With the Part of Fortune in the first house, you are faced with the challenge of finding the ""golden path"" in the middle between striving for individuality and independence and living within the community. First and foremost, you should remember not to interfere in areas where you would not accept interference from others. It will cause problems if you were to try to help people who are ready to start some project only to have them lose interest shortly thereafter. Do not believe that your lifestyle is appropriate for everyone, most people need the support of their community and do not find it difficult to adapt to expectations from others."
1507;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000018566;Your Part of Fortune in the Second House;"You will be happy if, during the course of your life, you come to recognize which values are important to you and are not afraid to admit having a need to feel secure. A feeling of fulfillment will come from working to build something, working toward the same goal over a long period of time and having something to rely on. In conjunction with your preference to remain a part of the material world, you enjoy working on concrete topics. Seeing things progress piece by piece is satisfying. Also it is extremely important for you to remain financially independent, earning your own income.



It is especially satisfying to discover that you can manage your own finances and take responsibility for your decisions. In this respect, money plays a large role; it has the function of providing you with the things that you consider useful to have. If it would be your intention to earn money to spend on useless prestige objects, this would divert you from your path and bar you from success. Acquiring wealth may not be seen as an end in itself; it is more a foundation for building a life.



Probably you are capable of consequently following the goals you set, which makes it necessary to consider whether they fit your character. Do not make the mistake of taking on other people's values. It is more important to develop tolerance and not to concern yourself with what other people think is important. If you are financially well situated and feel guilty about what you have earned, then it would all be a waste. Do not resist that you may have to change on occasion fearing this would interfere with your development; it is only helpful to detach yourself from things that you no longer value."
1508;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000034950;Your Part of Fortune in the Third House;"Communication, getting involved in intellectual debates in your environment and learning about new fields of study, are the things that make you happy. Trying to understand others will help you to grow and also come to a better understanding of yourself. Sometimes you have the feeling of being able to live many different lives because you make an effort to put yourself in other people's situations and try to understand how they think.



It is important to you to receive answers to all the questions you have and to frequently make interesting observations. Probably there is nothing better for you than to see that you have learned something. This means that intellectual wealth is more important to you than material possessions. Developing new methods or analyzing a complicated procedure is also very satisfying; it is your intention to make yourself useful and to work on inventing solutions to problems or making improvements (such as on procedures or on communication). Usually you prefer to rely on logic and reason because they can help to create clarity, in human relations as well as in other areas. With all the various sides to your personality, contact with many people is essential.



Most of all, you enjoy working on every day things which will, during the course of your life, raise your consciousness and help you to attain an understanding of philosophical principles without relying on an education in the classical sense. Try to get as much intellectual stimulation as you can; without it you will never recognize your potential."
1509;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000051334;Your Part of Fortune in the Fourth House;"The most basic human need is to feel that we make a difference, which is why people feel good when they are doing everything they can to contribute to the well being of people they feel close to or care for animals or even plants. It is also satisfying to observe the development of relationships, to see a child growing and watch trust evolve. With an attitude toward life so strongly oriented on giving, it is sometimes difficult for you to take; at the very least you want to show your appreciation immediately. Probably you have an emotional conscience. Recognition of the responsibility you take on for the well being of others comes very naturally from within you and determines much of your behavior. Seen this way, once you have found your fortune you will not take anything at the cost of others.



In the near future you may not have an easy time finding your way in the world, where social order does not always allow for the expression of deep emotions; also disappointments may arise when your good nature is abused or if you are deprived of recognition. That does not necessarily have to change your broad-minded attitude or prevent you from doing what you want to do. Naturally, you should set goals for yourself, but choose goals that you can relate to spiritually. If you act contrary to your feelings, your plans will never be realized. Try to establish closeness with all of your endeavors such that it leads to a personal identification. Soon you will recognize that this is what you need to be happy.



Family plays a very important role for you, especially your mother. Probably it is not easy for you to judge the situation objectively, but the feeling of belonging to your family can give you the kind of security other people search for their whole lives. This can be summarized by saying that you find fulfillment in the opportunity to express your feelings without having to abide by strict rules. Take care that you stay in contact with nature because you value your relationship to nature highly."
1510;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000067718;Your Part of Fortune in the Fifth House;"The fifth house is an area in which people experience their creativity and actively create. Because you find your Part of Fortune there, you will find fulfillment in your life only if you are given every opportunity to create according to your own will. This refers not necessarily to the most difficult (physical) construction work; you rather need a way to express yourself to bring your personality across, whereby the arts are especially appropriate. Your work will usually contain a playful element, although you make an effort to at least appear to take your work seriously and have no problems with responsibility or organizing extensively. Although it is no fun if you are not able to use the contacts you make to polish your self-image and bask in appreciation, certainly you do not want to have anything to do with people you feel do not respect you.



The tendency to constantly wander back and forth between the two poles, society and self-centeredness, is simple to explain - you are not able to recognize which of your qualities are special until you enter into society with others, and a positive self-image is very important to you.  Community is necessary to find out how much personality you have. Probably that will motivate you to add your own personal coloring to everything you do and see it as an expression of your creativity. Another possibility for self-expression is a good flirt, which you will have nothing against because your playfulness can be expressed more clearly in a harmless game of romance. Children are also associated with the fifth house, this means that you will be able to contribute to their happiness. You can have a lot of fun rediscovering your competitive nature and take part in small competitions with no inhibitions. You may get more excited than the kids about winning a game of pin the tail on the donkey.



Also it is very important for you to defend your vast imagination and not restrict yourself in this respect. The diversity of your thoughts will create your own little world where you make the rules and can order everything the way you want it."
1511;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000084102;Your Part of Fortune in the Sixth House;"Fulfillment will come from making yourself useful and concentrating on your work. Luxury, comfort and success or fame will not be important; you probably want to be sure to make effective use of your time and contribute your talents to well planned projects. Probably you work pragmatically and avoid unnecessary complications. An emphasis is placed on concrete goals, reliable workers and a practical orientation, whereby you are naturally inclined to work thoroughly, keeping an eye on the details.



Taking on menial work and following orders does not bother you, if it is necessary. It is important to be sure that you know how your role fits into the larger framework of things and to be able to contribute your part. Probably you will not have close friendships with people who like to dream and are not clear about what they want out of life; you will also have little understanding for difficult emotional problems, complicated mood swings or theories which tend to get out of hand.  You are generally willing to help and are happy to offer practical assistance which brings visible results. Especially in the areas of health and nutrition you can serve as a good example of how people should treat their bodies.



Most important is your consciousness, which can serve to guide your life by providing well thought out decisions. Because you need as much control over your fate as possible, you will not be able to endure being vulnerable, leaving your future dependent on unforeseeable factors. It would be best to find a job where you can make use of your methodical thoroughness and avoid getting entangled in complicated relationships where you cannot be sure if others value you or not. If you can, lead a simple and natural life and live freely, even if others find you a little strange. The biggest mistake would be to be inactive, sitting with your hands in your lap."
1512;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000100486;Your Part of Fortune in the Seventh House;"To find your fortune, look for a community where you can actively participate and where you feel comfortable enough to show your best side and make other people aware of their positive qualities. Probably you are constantly in search of companionship and are inclined to emphasize bonding factors over those that divide. Maybe you frequently catch yourself thinking more about other people's well-being than your own; success at the cost of your colleagues it not something you can enjoy. Maybe you ask yourself what actually makes up your identity, because you do not want to be isolated, you even find out what other people think before making a decision. But do not worry about it; work on finding yourself by letting your relationships get deeper. Do not insist on proving your individuality.



All of this should be enough to convince you to look for a job where you come into contact with people and which gives you the opportunity to incorporate service. You care about everyone you know, whether you know them privately or from work. Personal relationships with your colleagues will develop because rigid professionalism and strict rules are not your style. In spite of high expectations of respectable behavior, you are usually tolerant of the mistakes of others and tend to place no one but yourself under pressure.



As already indicated, you usually take on the opinions of people who are important to you, which is why it is not always easy to say what you really want. Sometimes you feel that certain people around you determine your life more than you will ever be able to. Once you have recognized this and are still content with the situation, the problem will have disappeared on its own. Feel fortunate that you are able to contribute to other people's happiness that in turn makes you feel happy."
1513;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000116870;Your Part of Fortune in the Eighth House;"As opposed to those who have their Part of Fortune in the seventh house and find happiness through giving, you will be able to take joyfully, which is actually a quality that is not so common. You are able to appreciate the true value of what is given to you, without feeling guilty about it and becoming obsessed with finding a way to repay it. Frequently you are occupied with thoughts on how to put the resources at your disposal to the best use. We can say that it makes you happy to make good use of the energies or materials that you acquire through professional contacts or your partner. This provides motivation to keep up the relationships that are most important to you, whereby you make an effort to notice what various people close to you value in order to behave likewise.



Possibly it will not be easy for you to restrain yourself and accept that your moral standards are not the only ones. In the course of your life, you will experience that people's hopes and dreams are similar, regardless of whether they are material or spiritual values. The only difficulty is recognizing true values, as opposed to useless possessions that eventually take possession of their owner. Once you can differentiate between the two, you will not hesitate to draw the consequences and get rid of that which is worthless, because the eighth house and its attached sign, Scorpio, represent transformation.



In the end it will make you happy to discover for yourself that you are capable of letting go and developing yourself further, of coming to terms with life's cycles and sensing a deep connection to life on this planet."
1514;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000133254;Your Part of Fortune in the Ninth House;"You will experience your happiness when you feel certain that you have come a few steps closer to the truth. In many respects you are a seeker who asks basic questions and is striving to find the meaning of existence. You want to develop yourself, focus your consciousness and gain an understanding of the concepts embodied in the institutions of our civilization. What you are striving for is wisdom both in thought and in action; although that sounds very determined you should not let it intimidate you. Naturally you are conscious of your imperfections, but that should not keep you from drawing the power you need for your search.



It makes you happy to connect with people through personal conversation that goes beyond every day topics. The ability to teach, which is ascribed to the sign Sagittarius as well as to the ninth house, will help you make yourself understood and spread your ideas, as people will be interested in your way of thinking. Maybe you will be able to develop your own ideas about a more humane society and convince others to try to live more in harmony with the cosmic order. Do not forget that tolerance is a prerequisite for the privilege of being allowed to observe how the thoughts which you cast out take root in the minds of other people and blossom.



It may be difficult for you, while you are in a secular environment, to keep an eye on the little everyday problems. Also you have to watch out that you do not develop a tendency to overintellectualize because truths do not just come from thought and when your heart does not contribute its part, you may lose touch with the joy you used to feel. Maybe you will discover that your search leads to yourself and that there is something divine in every being."
1515;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000149638;Your Part of Fortune in the Tenth House;"Happiness will come when you find the strength to develop personal integrity to remain true to your principles. It is truly an art to maintain a certain position and at the same time remain flexible without expecting others to have the same attitude. Also reducing everything to black and white or right and wrong is a grave mistake because life's structures are always more complicated. Your position in society, which is so important to you, will not be established until you take on the responsibility that goes along with it and organize your environment appropriately. This is why you will have to take on obligations that will not be easy to fulfill. In the end it will deeply satisfy you to be able to observe how structures develop and you receive the recognition you deserve. An unshakable self-image will be the result.



In time your decisions will be well thought out, and your strategies realistic such that you will begin to climb upwards. Also the ability to use social relationships to your advantage will help you to earn recognition. This will allow you to use your influence later to help colleagues out with useful advice. A deep sense of respect for every individual you meet will characterize you as fair and honest, which indicates that you accept other people's limits. At least you should try to develop these qualities if you want to enjoy life, because you probably will not be able to forgive yourself if you have an unpleasant manner. Also, you are big enough not to demand more than you can give yourself.



Because your well being is dependent on being sure that you are acting according to your moral convictions, your ethics will not allow you to make use of any advantages that you have not come about honestly. Still, if you let yourself be misled, it will get in the way of your own happiness because you will secretly punish yourself with guilt. For this reason it will be necessary for you to be sure about what you find to be legitimate. Just do not make the mistake of undergoing constant self-examination and destroying all spontaneity."
1516;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000166022;Your Part of Fortune in the Eleventh House;"Nothing makes you as happy as knowing that you are free to decide and that you have every opportunity. Only from this foundation are you capable of following a group instinct and making friends. Nothing will come from pressure but a defiant attitude. It may seem paradox, but you will recognize that the freer you feel, the more willing you will be to take on responsibility and then also to put effort into fulfilling it.



You need to have people around with whom you feel spiritually connected and who inspire you to develop universal ideas. Within a group you demonstrate your ability to aim your thoughts on the future and you air your ideas about the development of humanity. Probably people consider you witty or simply unusual because you surround yourself with unconventional personalities and enjoy exchanging opinions. It is a part of your personality to spread your ideas and to question everything you meet up with. Probably you will have enough energy to put your ideas into practice or at least to take the first step, as long as you surround yourself with people who are able to establish a community based on common convictions and you can work together toward common goals. Your drive to be creative in the group is so great that you find every activity and every area interesting.



The eleventh house is the opposite of the fifth house, where the will to present yourself has an emotional basis. Here your will has a stronger intellectual emphasis. A relationship may be impersonal in some respect and might be based more on intellectual closeness than on emotions. Nevertheless, you can be very loyal and conscientiously stand by your friends. Deepening friendships that challenge you intellectually and bring you to reflect will make you happy."
1517;KURZDEUTUNG_0000000000182406;Your Part of Fortune in the Twelfth House;"You will be happy as soon as you have developed the maturity to distance yourself from the stress of every day life, and find enough peace to look inside yourself. The twelfth house is the house of detachment, so that material success, money or recognition will not fulfill your Part of Fortune. You will not be happy until you have recognized that you do not need any of that. Maybe the path to this insight will not be easy, but you will be rewarded in the end by finding happiness within you; you alone are the key. With this, you will feel connected to every living thing and feel a kind of universal love that will bring you great joy. By making contact to your innermost being you could reach a higher level of consciousness.



To get there, you should free yourself from primary needs and concentrate on your spiritual well being. Do not let yourself be distracted from your drive for success or even unconscious reactions to everyday events. Try to avoid judging people, which will only serve to get you involved because you identify with the circumstances. It is your challenge to become independent and use this as a basis to contact people who are completely different from you. This position allows you to understand the world with your heart.  As with people who have their Part of Fortune in the ninth house you, are concerned with wisdom and truth, but your intellect is not involved as much as your soul is. By recognizing yourself and your human traits, you also find out about the meaning of your existence. Intuitive understanding will help more than hours of intellectual contemplation."
1518;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000002;His Sun in Conjunction with her Sun;"In order for this aspect to occur you both have to be born almost exactly on the same day, and you know what that means: you will share a conspicuous day in the year with someone else, and that won't always be easy. Because both of you were born in the same sign, you will find that you have a lot of common interests, but also some of the same faults. This constellation harbors the danger that these similarities will eventually lead you to find each other boring. You will often wonder how similar your experiences really are. More than with other aspects it will be necessary to give each other enough freedom to keep both of you clear of the potential danger of running emotionally and intellectually dry. Once you have understood this, more warmth can develop between you; this will manifest itself in mutual goodwill. In order to find out how to differentiate yourselves from each other, you should take a closer look at the rest of your horoscope and try to keep things in balance."
1519;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262146;His Sun in Conjunction with her Moon;This is an aspect in which the positions will be clearly divided. One of you will be allowed to be masculine while the other can express femininity. Just make sure that the male drive to dominate doesn't arouse an instinct to serve unconditionally in the other. It would be a shame because that would deprive you of a lot of harmonious experiences. You will be creative together and will inspire each other which will give you the opportunity to creatively bind the expression of masculinity with the feminine. That may be a goal you will have to take on together. If you are both interested in staying together over a longer period of time, your complementary relationship will bring you a fulfilling existence.
1520;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524290;His Sun in Conjunction with her Mercury;"This aspect should enable you to communicate clearly. You will support each other in your efforts to express your ideas. Although there may be a danger that erotic tenderness will be neglected, Mercury indicates intense intellectual activity. Still this interpretation is intended to provoke thoughts and suggest new ideas; before drawing definitive conclusions, you should take a look at the relationship between Venus and Mars in the partnership chart. In any case this relationship will have a potential for intellectual harmony, what you make of that is up to you. It would be best for you to try to find the most effective way to complement each other. That would help you to put your relationship on a more stable basis and to help you recognize possibilities for working together which may be lying dormant."
1521;SYNASTRIE_0000000000786434;His Sun in Conjunction with her Venus;This aspect should make it possible for you to build a loving relationship with plenty of trust and mutual understanding. You can care for each other and others may envy you when you go out in public. As a woman, you may have the opportunity to awaken the essence of your partner's personality, which will make him very grateful. Still you have to watch out that all this harmony doesn't make you forget the world around you. No matter how nice all of this may sound, real life is still always there and will continue to bring various types of challenges. If you make use of these opportunities and can recognize these challenges you should be in a position to see life realistically and handle anything coming up together.
1522;SYNASTRIE_0000000001048578;His Sun in Conjunction with her Mars;"In this relationship sexuality will play a great role, still the quantity won't be the most significant factor, but whether you are able to devote yourself to your partner. Your individual egos could be tremendous; but if you can manage to get them under your control, it will lead to an active and harmonious relationship. A certain drive to compete may be well and good, but can easily lead to conflicts.



On another level, a woman will be able to use her energies to support her partner. Maybe you should try to find out together how you can best complement each other's creativity, it may end up being the deciding factor which will help you to lead a fulfilled life together. If you make sure to give each other enough loving physical tenderness, you will be heading in the right direction."
1523;SYNASTRIE_0000000001310722;His Sun in Conjunction with her Jupiter;"The effects of this aspect will be dependent on both of your wishes and needs as well as on the state of the personal development of each of you. If a man feels driven to express his individuality, his partner should support him; she will have ample opportunity to do this. She should make sure that she treats him with understanding and she should reflect deeply to find out what is good for him. All of us know all too well where that will eventually lead. Basically this aspect is supposed to promote harmony and enthusiasm. If you both recognize your needs and make concessions to each other, both of you will learn to give your partner all the freedom necessary to make the relationship pleasant."
1524;SYNASTRIE_0000000001572866;His Sun in Conjunction with her Saturn;"This aspect is perfect for working on a project together; your partner will be able to put the finishing touches on your creations. It will all depend on whether it is possible for your partner to formulate individual thoughts or if she prefers to stand in your shadow. If that is the case, you may want to consider if it is possible to change that, which will be of great benefit to both of you. 

It is also possible that your partner is taking on the role of your mother and that you have become dependent on her advice and support, although you reject anything which seems restricting. It is important to recognize these tendencies so that you understand how much you mean to each other. That will put you in a position to give each other a feeling of security and stability. Of course, these manifestations will be dependent on the relationships between the other planets in your charts."
1525;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835010;His Sun in Conjunction with her Uranus;With this aspect your partner's flexibility will be very important because he is going to have to accept the fact that his partner is sometimes unpredictable. He should never criticize her because of this kind of behavior, it would be better to focus on what it adds to his life, in a positive way, even if he sometimes feels like things are getting out of his control. This experience may be an important step in his development which will teach him that he can't control everything, his partner will help him. Hopefully, both of you will be able to deal with the surprises which you will encounter along the path you take together. Still you should definitely take a look to see if your partnership horoscope offers opportunities to greet unexpected events with humor. Often relationships suffer from boredom after a while, which will certainly never be a problem with you.
1526;SYNASTRIE_0000000002097154;His Sun in Conjunction with her Neptune;"Here the man will have the final word; which will be necessary sometimes because his partner will have a knack confusing him. Still, if he weren't fascinated by this facet of her personality, he wouldn't have gotten involved in this relationship. Neptune's position in her birth chart will determine the intensity of it's concealing influence. If she has a tendency to be taken in by illusions, this will also effect the relationship. If she stands with both feet firmly on the ground, she will get both her partner and the relationship moving in a direction enabling you to treat each other lovingly. Your relationship is sure to be imaginative and gives you plenty of opportunities to find happiness in your daily lives. You will be enriched by creative and spiritual experiences."
1527;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359298;His Sun in Conjunction with her Pluto;With this aspect two people will have been brought together, who can learn a lot from each other, that is if you manage to stay together. A lot of things will run on instinct and will lead you into situations which will transform you. One partner may behave in a way which can only be described as extremely passionate. Together you will experience a broad emotional spectrum and if it works out, you will be able to go through your experiences in a positive way and make the relationship last a long time. Still if neither of you is in a position to overcome your nature, it will be difficult to work things out between you. Additionally you should consider other aspects of the partnership horoscope before making a definitive judgement about yourselves based solely on this aspect.
1528;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016386;His Sun in Opposition with her Sun;"An opposition between two Suns in a partnership horoscope indicates a very high potential for development. Whatever one of you is missing, the other will have; to express it simply. However the journey can be very painful. Both partners will be confronted with contradictory standpoints and will try to maintain their independence. So each of you will pursue different goals, which will make conflicts inevitable. It will depend on the willingness of each ego to give up their positions and accept new impulses and work them into your life together. If both of you overcome your own barriers, this aspect can offer a chance for a wonderful relationship characterized by mutual respect. With this aspect the relationship between the planets Venus and Mars will be very important; that will tell a lot about the intensity of the love and tenderness as well as your shared sex life."
1529;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278530;His Sun in Opposition with her Moon;This might be the classical aspect of a father/daughter or mother/son conflict. If you come to see a parent in your partner, it could be a confrontation which can be used constructively. Mind you, this kind of conflict is common. When does a woman other than his mother play an important role in his life? When he enters a partnership. The same is true for a woman, the first man she meets is usually her father. Both should be aware that the cards have been shuffled because he isn't her father and she isn't his mother. On this basis it should be possible to place the relationship on a firm foundation. A partner should give his mate opportunity to express her femininity. She will be grateful for it.
1530;SYNASTRIE_0000000000540674;His Sun in Opposition with her Mercury;You demonstrate a strong intellect when it comes to dealing with your partner which makes him wonder if he can keep up with you. If he is able to accept that there are some areas in which you are more experienced, he will ask you for advice. The resulting intense intellectual exchange should be carried out openly by both of you. Still it won't be easy to lead this relationship because tenderness may be neglected. If you are both aware of this and do everything you can to treat each other lovingly, you will find a way to live together in peace and harmony. It will only depend on whether that is what both of you really want.
1531;SYNASTRIE_0000000000802818;His Sun in Opposition with her Venus;If this aspect ever comes up in a partnership horoscope it will be a relationship full of challenges and conflicts. Fulfilling mutual needs for love and sex can always lead to frustrating experiences. Maybe her needs won't be satisfied and he may not know how to live up to her image of him. Intense soul searching and great tolerance will be necessary if both of you are interested in continuing this relationship. It will be important for you to set a common goal and to work towards it.
1532;SYNASTRIE_0000000001064962;His Sun in Opposition with her Mars;Both of you will become aware of each other's differences sooner or later because this aspect represents a challenge. It may be difficult for one of you to live up to the other's expectations. The way both of you behave in bed will reveal how much love is at stake. If you are using each other to let off steam, it may be acceptable for the time being. Although whether it can serve as a foundation for a lasting relationship will depend on your determination.
1533;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327106;His Sun in Opposition with her Jupiter;In the negative sense of this aspect one of you may feel overwhelmed by the other, although with a tendency to expand, your partner may see this as an enrichment to his life. There may be fundamental differences when it comes to the question of how a life together in today's society should be. If you can avoid an escalation of this conflict and secure individual freedom and independence, this relationship can last as long as there is creative input. Participating in activities and setting goals together will help you to find each other.
1534;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589250;His Sun in Opposition with her Saturn;This aspect will make things complicated because a lot will depend on how the partner's relationship to his mother has developed in the course of his life. If she dominated him and is still trying to, it will be very difficult for him to avoid seeing his mother in his partner. He may not see all the restrictive elements of his parent's house in her. If he has been able to become detached from it, he will hardly have any trouble convincing his partner to relax. Both of you should come to the realization that if you don't put some distance between you and your past, you will only be caging yourselves in. Finding this key is Saturn's challenge with this aspect. What will be most important is how much understanding your partner can muster up because she will need a lot of support to develop her self confidence.
1535;SYNASTRIE_0000000001851394;His Sun in Opposition with her Uranus;"With this aspect the flexibility of the partner will be very important, because if he is interested in continuing the relationship he is going to get used to the fact that his partner can be very unpredictable. Under no circumstances should he criticize her for her unpredictability; it would be better if he could learn to see what it adds to his life, in a positive sense. Even if he often feels like things are getting out of hand. Probably he will have to make his own experiences during the course of his development and find out that there are things beyond his control; his partner will be instrumental in guiding him to this insight. Hopefully both of you will be able to deal with the surprises which you will encounter as you travel your path together, but it won't be easy. You should find out if the partnership horoscope provides opportunities to greet all these surprises with humor. It would help both of you to come to terms with the nature of this aspect."
1536;SYNASTRIE_0000000002113538;His Sun in Opposition with her Neptune;"Here the man will have the final word; which will be necessary sometimes because his partner has a knack for confusing him. But if he finds this facet of her personality particularly fascinating is another question. He probably has a hard time coming to terms with it, but shouldn't forget that he chose to get involved with her. Neptune's position in your birth chart will determine the intensity of it's concealing influence. If she has a tendency to be taken in by illusions, this will weigh on the relationship. If she stands with both feet firmly on the ground, she will get both her partner and the relationship moving in a direction enabling you to treat each other lovingly. If it is important to both of you, you will surely find a way to make each other happy and to enrich your day to day life together with creative and spiritual experiences."
1537;SYNASTRIE_0000000002375682;His Sun in Opposition with her Pluto;With this aspect, two people have come together who can learn a lot from each other, if they manage to stay together. The most intense conflicts will occur in the context of instinctive behavior and will get you into situations which will bring you to transform yourselves. The time you spend together may be characterized as extremely passionate. Both of you will have to find it important to work out the relationship constructively, otherwise you may be at risk tearing each other apart. If neither of you is in a position to overcome your fear of change, it may be difficult to keep this relationship going. Here you should take all the aspects of the partnership horoscope into consideration before forming an opinion on one aspect of the chart.
1538;SYNASTRIE_0000000000032770;His Sun in Square with her Sun;"A square between two planets in a partnership horoscope will always indicate that a challenge can be expected. In this case, both Suns are forming a square aspect, thus both partners will be confronted with contradictory standpoints and will work to hold on to their independence. Because both of you follow your own goals, conflicts will be unavoidable. It will depend on whether each of your egos is able to give up its position and to pick up on impulses which promise to lead to a peaceful coexistence. If both overcome their inhibitions, this aspect can indicate a productive relationship which will be characterized by a tone of mutual respect. Especially with this aspect the relationship between the planets Venus and Mercury is very important; they will reveal knowledge about the intensity of love and tenderness as well as about your sex life."
1539;SYNASTRIE_0000000000294914;His Sun in Square with her Moon;This could be the classical aspect of a father/daughter or mother/son conflict. If you come to see a parent in your partner, it could be a confrontation which can be used constructively. Mind you, this kind of conflict is common. When does a woman other than his mother play an important role in his life? When he enters a partnership. The same is true for a woman, whose first encounter with a man should be with her father. Both should be aware that the cards have been shuffled because he isn't her father and she isn't his mother. On this basis it should be possible to place the relationship on a firm foundation. A partner should give his mate opportunity to express her femininity. She will be grateful for it.
1540;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557058;His Sun in Square with her Mercury;You demonstrate a strong intellect when it comes to dealing with your partner which makes you wonder if you can keep up with her. If he is able to accept that there are some areas in which she is more experienced, he will ask her for advice. The resulting intense intellectual exchange should be carried out openly by both of you. Still it won't be easy to lead this relationship because tenderness may be neglected. If you are both aware of this and do everything you can to treat each other with loving respect, you will find a way to live together in peace and harmony. It will only depend on whether that is what both of you really want.
1541;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819202;His Sun in Square with her Venus;If this aspect ever comes up in a partnership horoscope it will be a relationship full of challenges and conflicts. Fulfilling mutual needs for love and sex can always lead to frustrating experiences. Maybe her needs won't be satisfied and he may not know how to live up to her image of him. Intense soul searching and great tolerance will be necessary if both of you are interested in continuing this relationship. It will be important for this relationship to set a common goal and to work towards it.
1542;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081346;His Sun in Square with her Mars;Both of you will become aware of each other's differences sooner or later because this aspect is not necessarily of a harmonious nature. It may be difficult for one of you to live up to the other's expectations. Here the sexual behavior between the two of you will reveal how much love is at stake. If you are using each other to work off steam, it may be acceptable for the time being. Although if it can serve as a foundation for a lasting relationship will depend on your determination.
1543;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343490;His Sun in Square with her Jupiter;In the negative sense of this aspect one of you may feel overwhelmed by the other, although with a tendency to expand, your partner may see this as an enrichment to his life. There may be fundamental differences when it comes to the question of how a life together in today's society should be. If you can avoid an escalation of this conflict and secure individual freedom and independence, this relationship can last as long as there is creative input. Participating in activities and setting goals together will help you to find each other.

1548;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049154;His Sun in Trine with her Sun;This is an incredibly beautiful aspect bonding two people whose Suns are belong to the same element. Generally this is an excellent basis for an atmosphere of cooperation to develop, in which you complement each other wonderfully and support each other in your personal development. Common interests and shared views of life can enable this partnership to last a long time. If you are able to choose a creative goal to strive for, that will help you stay on your path together. This will offer you the opportunity to experience tranquility in a state of material security. Both of you will be able to assist each other to find your way to happiness.
1549;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311298;His Sun in Trine with her Moon;This is an incredibly beautiful aspect in which positions will be clearly assigned. The partner will be allowed to be feminine, while the male part can enjoy expressing his masculinity. You will complement each other perfectly because she will have a very feminine way of expressing her gratitude. If he makes sure to suppress his desire to being waited on hand and foot, this partnership will provide both of you with positive experiences in the coming years. Sharing creative activities as well as the way you inspire each other will bond masculine expression with feminine creativity. If both of you are interested in having a stable relationship, your way of complementing each other will contribute to your efforts to lead fulfilling lives.
1550;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573442;His Sun in Trine with her Mercury;"This aspect should enable you to communicate with each other in a clear, harmonious manner. You will be able to support your partner's search for a way to express his ideas. It will also be possible for you to treat each other lovingly accompanied by a stimulating exchange of compliments and expressing your affection with tender words. Maybe physical affection will be neglected, such as when your intellectual exchange is so fascinating that it doesn't leave enough time. Sex will be incidental, because the general atmosphere itself will be very satisfying. In any case there will be potential for intellectual harmony in this relationship. Nothing could be better than for you to examine how you can complement each other most effectively. That would help you to put this relationship on a firm foundation; but you may have already discovered that opportunities to be creative together are slumbering within you."

You can treat each other tenderly, which is why you will often be envied when you go out together. You will have the opportunity to awaken the essence of your partner's personality; which will make him very grateful. Still be careful that all this harmony doesn't cause you to forget the world around you. No matter how wonderful all this sounds, real life will still be out there with all kinds of challenges. If you can recognize these challenges, you should learn to tone your expectations down to conform to reality and to face life together."
1552;SYNASTRIE_0000000001097730;His Sun in Trine with her Mars;"In this relationship sexuality will play a very important role. Everything will depend on your willingness to devote yourself to your partner. It is to be expected that the harmonious nature of this aspect will help you to get a grip on your own forces of ego, enabling you to develop an active and harmonious partnership. A certain amount of competition will have a positive effect on the relationship. On another level your partner will have the capacity to use her energies to support you. Together you can find out how you can creatively complement each other; that will eventually lead you to a fulfilled existence. If you make sure that your relationship isn't lacking physical affection, you will be heading in the right direction."
1553;SYNASTRIE_0000000001359874;His Sun in Trine with her Jupiter;Here the male partner will play an important role in her partner's life and contribute to the expansion of his horizons. Naturally every partnership adds a lot to the two people's lives, still, with this aspect the partner will be better able to expand his horizons, so much so that he will be amazed. If the image of masculinity he has been presented with in his life is patriarchal and chauvinistic, he won't be able to keep it up, which shouldn't upset him at all, this aspect has a very harmonious nature. On the other hand her drive to dominate will show good intentions, which will lead you to share activities and interests with each other.
1554;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622018;His Sun in Trine with her Saturn;"This aspect will be perfect for working on a project together; your partner will have the capacity to add the finishing touches to things you initiate. The harmonious nature of this aspect should make it possible for her to formulate her thoughts independently, whereby she won't put herself in your shadow willingly, most likely, you wouldn't want that anyway. It is also possible that you will come to see your partner as a replacement for your mother, and need her support and advice, and at the same time reject any behavior which you see as restrictive. Still, these tendencies should be kept within limits and both of you will be quick to realize just how important you are for each other. This will enrich the relationship with an atmosphere in which security and stability aren't just empty words."
1555;SYNASTRIE_0000000001884162;His Sun in Trine with her Uranus;With this aspect the male part will know that he has to be flexible because he loves the unpredictability of his partner. He sees this potential for surprise as a way to renew his life even if it sometimes seems like he has completely lost control. He is willing to accept this because he intends to stay with her for a long time. He may welcome the experience of knowing how it is not to have everything under control. The partner will be at his side offering advice and assistance and will enjoy the flood of surprises in your path. Although you can't tell if a relationship is going to last a lifetime by looking at one harmonious aspect.
1556;SYNASTRIE_0000000002146306;His Sun in Trine with her Neptune;He will sometimes ask how his partner was able to trap him but nonetheless he will find the experience fascinating. He wouldn't stay with her if she weren't imaginative enough to transform everything concerning this relationship into a creative experience. It will hardly get to the point where she is distorting his perception. Even if she is generally prone to get carried away with her imagination, the harmonious nature of this aspect will lead her to accept her partner's support and plant both feet firmly on the ground. She will be able to give the relationship an impulse which will make it possible for you to treat each other lovingly.

1568;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000066;His Moon in Conjunction with her Sun;This is a case of reversal of the traditional roles. Maybe one of you will make sure that she always has the last word. Not that her partner will have a problem with that, but he should watch out that he doesn't feel aggressive deep inside because his mother was dominant in the past few years of his life. This will all depend on the kind of relationship he has had with his mother and how it has evolved. Does he need to have a female in charge or did he do something to contribute to the situation? Both of you should reflect on your expectations of the relationship. Then hopefully you will be able to complement each other so that this aspect will be a healing experience and will prove to be harmonious and reliable.
1569;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262210;His Moon in Conjunction with her Moon;"This aspect will give you the possibility to melt into each other on an emotional level. The receptive female qualities will be expressed more strongly, which are the qualities she values most in him. He can listen to her for hours on and always knows what she wants, while she intuitively understands what is going on inside him. With complete devotion to each other, both of you will enjoy creatively structuring your lives together.



Even if this aspect indicates a deep bond, you should take a look at the other aspects of this partnership horoscope, because constantly living in complete harmony can get boring after a while. Life is made of challenges of various kinds."
1570;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524354;His Moon in Conjunction with her Mercury;Your partner is a great listener. Especially subjects concerning your femininity won't leave him cold. This will allow for a constant exchange on a communicative level, even if there may be some danger that he may think some of what she says is too rational. If he should ever have the feeling his mother is standing over him scolding him with a raised index finger, it will lead to conflicts, although these should be productive. This will allow the frustrations which have developed to settle. By admitting your needs and wishes to each other, both of you will learn to live together in harmony.
1571;SYNASTRIE_0000000000786498;His Moon in Conjunction with her Venus;"This aspect will emphasize the receptive qualities in both partners. You will be amazed by the sensitivity with which your partner approaches you. Your interests will quickly become his. Together you will experience creativity in many areas of life. If you have artistic abilities of any kind, your partner will be able to bring them out.



However there is the danger that everything around you will seem to be too rosy. Life is made up of various challenges. Harmonious togetherness is wonderful, but make sure that you don't neglect other areas of life. Sometimes it will do you good to look at things more objectively. But this is intended only as a hint because all in all you will be able to lead this relationship in a way both of you will find very satisfying."
1572;SYNASTRIE_0000000001048642;His Moon in Conjunction with her Mars;Here the impulses will definitely come from the woman and that will suit her partner fine. Sexuality will play a great role, whereby the signs containing the man's Moon and the woman's Mars will be of special significance. Also his relationship to his mother will play an important role in this context. If he was dominated by her, that may continue. In spite of that, this aspect will serve to reveal that his partner isn't his mother and never will be. This is why both of you should become aware of this subconscious mechanism, because if this partnership is supposed to last a long time, in the end you are going to have to lead it together.
1573;SYNASTRIE_0000000001310786;His Moon in Conjunction with her Jupiter;The man will sometimes feel suffocated by his partner's expectations, and thinks he will never be able to live up to these anyway. However, if she can acquire enough good will, he shouldn't have any trouble finding an appropriate way to express himself. If both of you want to make use of the intense and stimulating qualities of this aspect, you should formulate the kinds of needs and desires both of you feel. If you grant each other freedom, this relationship will receive the kind of impulses one can be expected from a harmonious coexistence. How long this relationship lasts will depend on the other factors of the partnership horoscope and on just how loving your relationship turns out to be.
1574;SYNASTRIE_0000000001572930;His Moon in Conjunction with her Saturn;Your partner may try to exercise a restrictive influence on you. Especially on an emotional level, she could try to force her way of seeing things on you. If you have the feeling that she wants to oppress you, it will be time to examine the situation more closely. Here it will naturally depend on both of your levels of awareness of these mechanisms in your relationship. You may not be capable of looking at your emotional state with objective distance, while she sees things very realistically due to the more severe qualities she has acquired through her past experiences. No matter what, there will be a chance to have an honest confrontation and make progress in this area.
1575;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835074;His Moon in Conjunction with her Uranus;"Here your partner will always be good for surprises. You will feel this especially on an emotional level. Even if you usually enjoy it, you may be prone to feel insecure and then not know how to go about making that clear to your partner. Naturally this aspect will be dependent on the position of the planet Uranus in your partner's birth chart. If she is inclined to impulsive action, that will have an effect on the relationship. If she isn't prone to that kind of behavior, she will be capable of surprising you with a sincere expression of affection. Basically it will be noticeable that this aspect will bring a lot of changes into both of your lives; whether you can stand that, will be up to you."
1576;SYNASTRIE_0000000002097218;His Moon in Conjunction with her Neptune;This aspect will produce a kind of mystic atmosphere making both of you feel attracted to each other. Each of you will sense the needs and desires of the other with a great deal of sensitivity. The deep interests you share will give the partnership creative impulses, because Neptune and the Moon will unite two principles that will bring the two of you to recognize the significance of this within a greater context. If the rest of this partnership horoscope doesn't show extremely disharmonious characteristics, the relationship will last a long time.
1577;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359362;His Moon in Conjunction with her Pluto;"Here the relationship will be dependent to a great extent on the balance each of you maintain outside the partnership. You should be prepared to have your emotional world put to the test, because your partner is going to see exactly what has to be changed in your life. If you choose to let her because you agree that you will both benefit, you should end up pooling your dynamic energies to build a foundation for the relationship, on which you can live more or less ""worry free"". You should be very grateful for the emotional security your partner provides, while she appreciates having enough trust to let herself fall."
1578;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016450;His Moon in Opposition with her Sun;A woman will want to see her femininity reflected in her partner although whether he has gotten away from a purely masculine existence or is being dominated by her, is difficult to say. Here it is important to take a closer look at the rest of the partnership horoscope. The challenge is in reaching a clear understanding between man and woman and to put it into practice in daily life. It will take a long time to get there, but if both of you are sure that you want to stay together, a path leading in this direction will open up in front of you. Until then it will be important to work on clearing up misunderstandings and to survive crises. Here it should be mentioned that not every relationship has to last forever. Certainly, it isn't a tragedy if two people meet each other, fall in love and after a while go their separate ways. Unfortunately these days this happens in a very aggressive manner and aggression sometimes makes people forget that they were once drawn to each other by love. This is a very human experience and it is to be hoped that people become aware of these cycles and learn to use the energy released during that time creatively.
1579;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278594;His Moon in Opposition with her Moon;The feelings of both partners will be very different from each other so that you may react completely different in the same situation. Probably it is not easy to deal with the problems this aspect brings, even if you are very interested in each other. Your intuition will drive you to opposite poles and it is probably hard for you to make your partner understand the way you feel. Emotional security may be out of reach for both of you. Don't ever stop sharing things with each other or the relationship won't stand a chance.
1580;SYNASTRIE_0000000000540738;His Moon in Opposition with her Mercury;"The man's feelings will go in another direction than the woman's thoughts. This will most likely result in misunderstandings; possibly he has the feeling that she isn't interested in what is going on inside him and isn't able to put herself in his place. She can't understand that he isn't open for her ideas, which may be just a demonstration of his defiance. He would like to give her warmth and comfort, while she misses stimulating discussions with him. It won't be easy for you to just relax together."
1581;SYNASTRIE_0000000000802882;His Moon in Opposition with her Venus;This relationship may contain some emotional conflicts. You have different ideas about harmony in a partnership. She may find him moody and suffer because he isn't able to satisfy her needs. Maybe he doesn't recognize her feminine qualities or is even afraid of her femininity. On the other hand he may accuse her of being able put herself in the position of everyone else and really understand them, therefore having no understanding for him. Even if she tries she may have trouble getting close to him. This is a challenging aspect maybe resulting in a disappointment. You should both approach your problems with a lot of sensitivity.
1582;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065026;His Moon in Opposition with her Mars;Here there is a danger of recklessly ignoring your partner's feelings and hurting him deeply. Maybe you want to dominate him by any means possible and don't give him a chance to show you who he really is. You think of him as being weak and try to provoke him to become aware of his strengths. Still these games won't help him because he is looking for a feeling of security not competition. You should really be a little more caring and try to understand the way he feels, if you want this relationship to have a chance. On the other hand he could let himself get caught up in your ideas and try to live life more courageously.
1583;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327170;His Moon in Opposition with her Jupiter;"This is a challenging aspect because the woman's drive for freedom can make her partner feel insecure. His world is too small for her; she is curious and open for new developments. Her thoughts are occupied with philosophy and ethics, while he prefers to take care of the smaller problems of every day life. Her basic mood is more optimistic than his and it takes him a lot longer to get over an insult or a disappointment. Maybe he will accuse her of not being interested in his personality, preferring to go out and be with a crowd of people rather than staying at home with him. If you want to resolve your conflicts in this respect, you are going to have to put in a lot of effort."
1584;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589314;His Moon in Opposition with her Saturn;This opposition will lend your partnership a bitter note. Both of you will be apt to fight battles which you have brought with you from your childhoods. That can put both partners in danger of becoming unstable. Your partner will have the habit of ignoring your feelings and commanding you around. Maybe you don't feel that she understands you and her emotional frigidity may be frustrating. She also has high expectations and doesn't understand that you can't deal with that. If you could learn to rely on her affection, that would be tremendous progress. She should really make more of an effort to be more open to your needs.
1585;SYNASTRIE_0000000001851458;His Moon in Opposition with her Uranus;He finds his partner too unpredictable and she can thoroughly confuse him. She has a hard time satisfying his need for emotional security, maybe she is simply too immature and lets herself get distracted easily. It may be that she is bored with this relationship and can't understand why he wants to stay home rather than go out and meet people. Monotony will hardly be a problem with you, although you probably will neglect to satisfy each other's basic needs. The woman is going to have to learn responsibility, but will have to keep her freedom in order to express her individuality.
1586;SYNASTRIE_0000000002113602;His Moon in Opposition with her Neptune;She will be difficult for him to understand which will be complicated by the fact that problems in this relationship won't be laid open, but are more likely to be swept under the carpet. Both will allow emotional confusion to develop and will have trouble forming a realistic image of the other. You will sense an indefinite longing, but because it won't be expressed in words, your partner won't be able to respond to it. Maybe your ideals are too high and you aren't able to manage your day to day responsibilities. Don't try to reach for the stars, but create your own little paradise on Earth, otherwise this relationship will have an unpleasant ending.
1587;SYNASTRIE_0000000002375746;His Moon in Opposition with her Pluto;"This partnership is guaranteed to never get boring, but also will seldom be harmonious. Maybe you are looking for the kind of security your partner has to offer, but are incapable of accepting it out of fear of becoming dependent. You will bring excitement into this relationship, which your partner won't always find pleasant. Maybe he is a little overwhelmed and can't stand up to your will power. You will have trouble dealing with his emotions and making yourself more sensitive to his feelings. Because you are quickly dissatisfied with the situation, you will need constant change; this in turn may cause a conflict with your partner's need for security. This aspect will be a challenge that could teach you a lot."
1588;SYNASTRIE_0000000000032834;His Moon in Square with her Sun;A woman will want to see her femininity reflected in her partner although whether he has gotten away from a purely masculine existence or is being dominated by her, is difficult to say. Here it is important to take a closer look at the rest of the partnership horoscope. The challenge is to reach a clear understanding between man and woman and to put it into practice in daily life.

1589;SYNASTRIE_0000000000294978;His Moon in Square with her Moon;Each of you has brought unresolved problems with you in the relationship which will effect the present relationship. Conflicts can develop if you don't talk about things, such as what you find loving. Even if your relationship is sexually fulfilling, you can have very different emotional experiences.
1590;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557122;His Moon in Square with her Mercury;Each of you has brought unresolved problems with you in the relationship. He has the feeling that she approaches every subject intellectually and misses warmth in the relationship. She has a hard time dealing with his mood shifts and emotions. The problems which will result can only be resolved if you are able to accept each other as equals and avoid creating a mother-child relationship.
1591;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819266;His Moon in Square with her Venus;"This square will bring problems in every day life, especially concerning your mothers. You should take time to think about whether you are turning into your mother  even if you aren't consciously aware of it  which can cause frustration. Maybe your partner isn't sure what he wants from you because he has completely different needs in a friendship. When you fight, he has a hard time standing up to you. If this relationship lasts will depend on the other factors in the partnership horoscope; especially your capacity for resolving problems constructively."
1592;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081410;His Moon in Square with her Mars;This square indicates that you are being tormented by inner conflicts. You watch the way the partner greets life with courage and energy and feel small and insignificant next to her. Maybe she thinks that you are a weakling, because you are apt to give in to your moods and make yourself more vulnerable than you really are. At worst he may feel tyrannized by her and may hold her responsible for his unhappiness, while he hits back underhanded. If your partnership is to last, you have to be open with each other and discuss all your problems immediately.
1593;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343554;His Moon in Square with her Jupiter;"Probably you don't feel as secure with your partner as you would like. Your partner needs her freedom and is much more open for new experiences. Maybe she loves to travel while you prefer to stay at home. She is interested in spiritual and philosophical subjects and you perceive the world through your feelings, therefore your discussions can be very intense and often end in an argument. You have the feeling that she can never really respect you, which is probably right. Although if you try to ""chain"" your partner to you, it would rob the relationship of a lot of its value."
1594;SYNASTRIE_0000000001605698;His Moon in Square with her Saturn;This is a challenging aspect which will make it difficult for both of you to express your feelings openly and honestly. Your partner will have little understanding for your inner world and will try to dominate you. You will suffer under her emotional frigidity, but won't be able to get away from her because she provides you with stability and security on a social level. Maybe she thinks that you are moody and too weak and has high expectations you can't fulfill. The external success is not as important to you as it is to her. Both of you may feel helpless because you want to clear things up in conversation, which is difficult in this relationship. Take a look at the other aspects of this horoscope.
1595;SYNASTRIE_0000000001867842;His Moon in Square with her Uranus;This square will emphasize the man's masculine need for approval, which basically means that he is tormented by jealousy 24 hours a day  even if he isn't aware of it. His partner loves being independent and isn't willing to let herself be put on a chain. This will scare the man because he thinks that the partnership is getting out of his control. Also he is often hurt by her unpredictable behavior. He doesn't feel secure with her, although he doesn't want to admit it. It may be that this relationship won't last very long, unless other aspects in this horoscope indicate otherwise.
1596;SYNASTRIE_0000000002129986;His Moon in Square with her Neptune;This square won't make it easy for you to see reality as it unfolds. You confront problems emotionally and you will seldom find constructive solutions. When you argue you often step over boundaries, which should be respected. Especially your partner has the feeling that you are hiding something from him, even if he isn't sure what it is. You will completely confuse him emotionally, and may not even notice it. You may not see each other realistically. If you want to improve the situation, you should approach it rationally and be prepared to accept the truth, even if it is unpleasant.
1597;SYNASTRIE_0000000002392130;His Moon in Square with her Pluto;You were looking for a strong partner, who you could hardly control and who doesn't require a lot of support. She would prefer you to take more risks and not look for comfort in the middle of the family. While she wants to experience things which you are afraid of, you prefer to stay at home and make yourself comfortable. She loves to overturn convention and live out her strengths. It may be that power struggles are going on below the surface not helping either of you. You should come to terms with the fact that you won't find the emotional security you need with this woman.
1598;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049218;His Moon in Trine with her Sun;This aspect is a case of reversal of the traditional roles. Maybe your partner will insist on having the last word. This will depend to a great extent on the kind of relationship he has had to his mother and how they treat each other today. Does he need to have a female in charge or did he do something to contribute to the situation? The harmonious nature of this aspect should have already served to clear up his relationship to his mother, if that isn't the case then you will be able to support him in his efforts to work on the relationship. In addition both of you should find a way to complement each other to bring out this aspect's healing effect and to prove itself to be both harmonious and reliable.
1599;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311362;His Moon in Trine with her Moon;With this aspect the Moons of both partners will be in the same elements. This will allow a wonderful flow of emotions to develop between you. The receptive feminine qualities will be expressed more intensely and that is what she appreciates most about him. He can listen for hours and always knows what she would like, while she intuitively understands what is going on inside him. With complete devotion to each other, you will both enjoy creatively structuring your lives together. This aspect is conducive to a relationship in which you can become one on an emotional level.
1600;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573506;His Moon in Trine with her Mercury;"Your partner is a great listener. He will be especially understanding when approaching subjects concerning your feminine side. This will allow for a constant exchange on a communicative level, even if he may think that some of what she says is too rationally oriented, both will be able to discuss it constructively. Because both of you admit your needs and wishes, you should be able to live together in harmony for a long time to come.



Even if your enthusiasm is justified, a harmonious aspect doesn't guarantee a Garden of Eden. You have to create the foundation yourselves, then you can harvest the fruits."
1601;SYNASTRIE_0000000000835650;His Moon in Trine with her Venus;This aspect will emphasize the feminine qualities in both of you. Your partner will love you for your sensitivity and it wouldn't be unusual if you had a lot of common interests. No couple could be more loving than the two of you. Your deep affection for each other should be intensified by sharing creative experiences in many areas of life. If your partner has an artistic talent, you will be in a position to bring it out.
1602;SYNASTRIE_0000000001097794;His Moon in Trine with her Mars;Here the impulses will definitely come from the woman. These will be gratefully incorporated into her partner's emotional state. Sexuality will play a great role, and the signs containing the man's Moon and the woman's Mars will be of special significance. Also the way his relationship to his mother has evolved over the years will play an important role in this context. If his memories are unpleasant or if he was dominated by her, he will now have the opportunity together with his partner, to get over it and to see that this partnership has nothing to do with the past. This is a foundation allowing you to find a path to take on which you can lead your lives together.
1603;SYNASTRIE_0000000001359938;His Moon in Trine with her Jupiter;The man will sometimes feel suffocated by his partner's expectations, which he will never be able to live up to anyway. However, if she can acquire enough good will, he shouldn't have any trouble finding an appropriate way to express himself. If both of you want to make use of the intense but harmonious qualities of this aspect, you should formulate the kinds of needs and desires both of you feel. If you grant each other freedom, this relationship will receive the kind of impulses leading you to a relationship characterized by mutual respect. How long this relationship lasts will depend on the other factors of the partnership horoscope and on just how loving your relationship will turn out to be. Naturally this is true of every romance.
1604;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622082;His Moon in Trine with her Saturn;It is possible that your partner will try to exercise a restrictive influence on you. But because this is a harmonious aspect, the opposite is more likely to be the case: Your partner may give you a sense of security because she will never be guilty of emotional recklessness. She may give you the stability you have been looking for, while taking the partnership very seriously. Even if it comes to a confrontation, the mutual respect will remain in tact and you should try to find a constructive solution. You may even be able to loosen her up a little and help her to become softer.
1605;SYNASTRIE_0000000001884226;His Moon in Trine with her Uranus;"With this aspect your partner's emotional world will be thoroughly scrambled, but in a pleasant way. Your partner will provide impulses although he won't always be able to understand their nature. Still he will enjoy his experiences with her. One subject you won't be able to avoid confronting is irresponsibility. A goal worth pursuing is the transformation of emotional insecurity into stability. You may be successful in making this relationship last; it would be best to take a look at the other aspects of this partnership horoscope before making any definitive statements about the course of this relationship."
1606;SYNASTRIE_0000000002146370;His Moon in Trine with her Neptune;This aspect will produce a kind of mystic atmosphere in which both of you will feel attracted to each other. Each of you will perceive the needs and desires of the other with a great deal of sensitivity. The deep interests you share will give the partnership creative impulses, because Neptune and the Moon will unite two principles that will bring the two of you to recognize the significance of this within a greater context. If the rest of this partnership horoscope doesn't show extremely disharmonious characteristics, the relationship will last a long time.
1607;SYNASTRIE_0000000002408514;His Moon in Trine with her Pluto;"Here the relationship will be to a great extent dependent on the balance each of you maintains outside the partnership. You should be prepared to have your emotional world put to the test, because your partner is going to see exactly what has to be changed in your life. If you choose to let her, because you see that both of you will benefit, you should end up pooling your dynamic energies to build a foundation for the relationship, on which you can live more or less ""worry free"". You should be very grateful for the emotional security your partner provides, while she appreciates having enough trust to let herself fall."
1608;SYNASTRIE_0000000000065602;His Moon in Sextile with her Sun;This aspect is a case of reversal of the traditional roles. Maybe your partner will insist on having the last word. This will depend to a great extent on the kind of relationship he has had to his mother and how they treat each other today.

1609;SYNASTRIE_0000000000327746;His Moon in Sextile with her Moon;With this aspect the Moons of both partners will be in complementary elements. If the woman's Moon is in Pisces, a water element, and the man's Moon is in Taurus, an Earth element, this is referred to as complementary because Taurus' earth can use Pisces' water. More specifically that may mean that both will melt into each other emotionally. The receptive feminine qualities will be expressed more intensely and that is also what she appreciates most about him. He can listen for hours and always knows what she would like, while she intuitively understands what is going on inside him. With complete devotion to each other, you will both enjoy creatively forming your lives together.

You should be very grateful for the emotional security your partner provides, while she appreciates having enough trust to let herself fall."
1618;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000130;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Sun;The lady will set the tone, but hopefully not so much that she makes her partner feel threatened or fear that your mother's negative qualities may take over. That will depend on the relationship between him and his mother how it has evolved over time. If he has been oppressed and hasn't worked things out with his mother yet, he should try be creative in working through anything which reminds him of the past, together with his partner. There will be no question as to whether there is enough intellectual potential for a constructive confrontation of this subject. Treat each other well so that neither of you feel handicapped when you are expressing yourself and can live a harmonious life.
1619;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262274;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Moon;Conversation with your partner will make you feel valued. He is in a position to treat your femininity in a way which you will find very pleasant. On the other hand you will be able to follow his thoughts intuitively, leading you to a deep understanding. This aspect supports a harmonious coexistence. If you make sure that you don't spoil your partner rotten, this relationship may have the potential to last a long time.
1620;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524418;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Mercury;You are kindred spirits, who should make it easy to resolve any conflict. You sympathize with each other and are each open to the other's ideas. This is a wonderful aspect because you should find that you share a lot of interests, enjoy the same literature etc. Your logic will work the same way, thus it will be easy for both of you to follow the other's train of thought.
1621;SYNASTRIE_0000000000786562;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Venus;There should be a lot of common interests in this relationship because the man's rationality will be very compatible with her need for harmony. She probably admires his logic and likes to listen to him, because he never overlooks her needs and is willing to stand by her when she needs support. Both prefer the same artistic styles, thus you should have no problems to agree on a decor for your home. He likes to get his inspiration from his partner and may even become a warm and likable person through her.
1622;SYNASTRIE_0000000001048706;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Mars;This is an exciting aspect because the man's intellect will have a stimulating effect on his partner and will be a challenge to her. On the other hand he is going to have to keep up with all of her activities which may lead him to a new way of seeing things. This aspect will also be significant with respect to sex. Probably the woman will take the initiative in this direction, which is alright with him. There will be a danger of letting the relationship get too intellectual, but if he lets himself get caught up in her enthusiasm for getting out and doing things, this relationship should have a good chance.
1623;SYNASTRIE_0000000001310850;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Jupiter;"This conjunction will enable a synthesis of theory and practice. He supports his partner in her efforts to realize her abstract ideas. Both have a great thirst for knowledge in different directions; nonetheless these complement each other. He can have problems taking care of small problems of his every day life and may keep his attention on detail, while she prefers to strive for a comprehensive, intellectual world from a distance. This will allow both to profit from each other."
1624;SYNASTRIE_0000000001572994;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Saturn;The woman will have a great influence on her partner's thoughts, still she should make sure that she doesn't restrict him too much and stifle his imagination. She could teach him what it means to take on responsibility and to take care of organizing every day life. This will form his mind and help him to develop maturity and the capacity to reflect. He wants her approval and will think a lot about her opinions. This aspect speaks for a stable relationship in which no decisions are made under time pressure.
1625;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835138;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Uranus;The woman will have a stimulating effect on her partner's intellect. An intense exchange of ideas should develop which will be productive because new ideas are constantly being created. She doesn't have any limitations and is interested in everything new. That impresses him and animates him to the highest achievements. Maybe her impulsive behavior causes turmoil, but it is sure never to be boring. In this relationship both partners will have the opportunity to expand their intellectual horizons encompassing new ideas.
1626;SYNASTRIE_0000000002097282;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Neptune;"This aspect will create a synthesis of his intellect and her imagination. He should enjoy getting a tour of her world and learning what it means to trust his intuition. On the other hand he can bring her back down to Earth whenever she gets caught up in her dreams and has a hard time coming to terms with the daily problems. Both will complement each other well; she can inspire him to emotional and inspirational ideas, while he will help her to structure her imagination and to develop a sense of reality."
1627;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359426;His Mercury in Conjunction with her Pluto;She will probably initiate a lot of changes in his thoughts. The relationship will force him to think about things which interest her, yet being completely new to him. Maybe she will confuse him so thoroughly, that he will have to develop a completely new way of thinking. This will initiate a novel chance for intellectual growth. It may also motivate changes with respect to sex and lead him to a free and more tolerant way of approaching this subject. Probably she will have a stronger will than he does, which can only help the relationship.
1628;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016514;His Mercury in Opposition with her Sun;You demonstrate a powerful intellect when it comes to dealing with your partner which may give her the feeling that you are walking all over her. If she values your expertise, she will ask you for advice. The resulting intense intellectual exchange should be carried out openly by both of you. He should be careful how he influences the development of your personality. It won't necessarily be easy to lead this relationship because tenderness may be neglected. If you both accept the intellectual challenge and are aware that you should do everything you can to treat each other lovingly, you will find a way to live together in peace and harmony. It will only depend on whether that is what both of you really want.
1629;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278658;His Mercury in Opposition with her Moon;"The woman's feelings will go in another direction than the man's thoughts. This will most likely result in misunderstandings; possibly she has the feeling that he isn't interested in what is going on inside her and isn't able to put himself in her place. He can't understand that she isn't open for his ideas, which may be just a demonstration of her defiance. Se would like to give him warmth and comfort, while he misses stimulating discussions with her. It won't be easy for you to just relax together."
1630;SYNASTRIE_0000000000540802;His Mercury in Opposition with her Mercury;There may be frequent problems understanding each other, because you think very differently, and are in fact opposites of each other. Both of you could have a hard time following your partner's logical steps and agreeing with her or his views. If you want to get along you have to learn to be tolerant and willing to compromise.
1631;SYNASTRIE_0000000000802946;His Mercury in Opposition with her Venus;This is a very difficult aspect because your partner may have the feeling that although you take her seriously intellectually, you don't meet her emotional needs. Maybe she would like to show affection, while you are more interested in an intellectual exchange. Maybe you are overwhelmed by her need for affection and her female character remains a mystery to you. You may accuse her of not being able to approach subjects with any amount of rational objectivity and making decisions based only on emotion. No matter what happens you have to invest a lot of energy in your conflicts.
1632;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065090;His Mercury in Opposition with her Mars;"With this opposition you can count on intense conflicts. Maybe you have sexual needs which your intellectual partner isn't able to fulfill. You throw yourself into life, while he takes time to consider before doing anything. Your drive to keep busy will be obstructed by his attitude, just as he will have problems dealing with your energy. The resulting conflicts could be very turbulent; both of you should take care not to hurt the other."
1633;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327234;His Mercury in Opposition with her Jupiter;"There could be problems because your view of the world just doesn't jam with your partner's practical thinking. Maybe you find him to be too conservative and would like him to look at life more objectively and understand the larger context of things. On the other hand, he finds you superficial because according to him, you never bother with details. This may result in communication problems. You will probably start pursuing new interests frequently and are intellectually more flexible than your partner; it could be good for him to partially adopt your attitude towards life."
1634;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589378;His Mercury in Opposition with her Saturn;"Maybe your partner is restricting your intellectual freedom and can't accept your ideas because she wants enough security to maintain the status quo. She would like to dominate and tries to influence you. Maybe she feels responsible for everything, and doesn't give you a chance to become a responsible adult and make your own decisions. With enough good will it should be possible to find a way out of this mess; then the relationship could be stable."
1635;SYNASTRIE_0000000001851522;His Mercury in Opposition with her Uranus;Here the sparks probably fly often enough, stimulating your intellectual exchange. Sometimes you will be overwhelmed by your partner's unpredictable nature, because you would need a flexible and creative mind if you want to give this relationship even a minimum of stability. Often you simply can't follow what she is doing. On her part a lot of effort is required to make herself understandable. If you want to stay together, you have to get used to the fact that logic won't get you very far with her. In turn, she will inspire you and open new worlds to you. With a little consideration things may even be harmonious.
1636;SYNASTRIE_0000000002113666;His Mercury in Opposition with her Neptune;Probably in this partnership it is the man who makes the decisions and tries to be realistic. His partner can give him a hard time in this respect, because she may undermine his logic with her dreams. He will find her very attractive and interesting, because he will experience a lot of new things with her, although she will always remain a mystery for him. The contrast between both may simply be too large to maintain a relationship over a longer period of time.
1637;SYNASTRIE_0000000002375810;His Mercury in Opposition with her Pluto;It may be difficult for you to get along. With your partner's will power and energy, she may try to influence your thinking as well as manipulate your decisions, which you will fight with every ounce of reason. Power struggles may be part of your daily agenda and could thoroughly screw up your life, because your discussions are seldom productive. You are faced with a challenge offering you an opportunity to grow. If the attraction between you wouldn't be so great, you would have nothing to do with each other.
1638;SYNASTRIE_0000000000032898;His Mercury in Square with her Sun;You demonstrate a powerful intellect when it comes to dealing with your partner which may give her the feeling that you are walking all over her. If she values your expertise, she will ask you for advice. The resulting intense intellectual exchange should be carried out openly by the both of you. He should be careful how he influences the development of her personality. It won't necessarily be easy to lead this relationship because tenderness may be neglected. If you both accept the intellectual challenge and are aware that you should do everything you can to treat each other with loving respect, you will find a way to live together in peace and harmony. It will only depend on whether that is what the both of you really want.
1639;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295042;His Mercury in Square with her Moon;This square will bring conflicts between her exaggerated mothering and his intellectual nature. This can cause problems in communication having an adverse effect on the partnership. Make an effort to talk about your problems, fears, worries and troubles because there is no alternative. Maybe you will be able to understand his way of thinking and he can get in touch with your feelings.
1640;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557186;His Mercury in Square with her Mercury;"You could have a lot of trouble reaching a consensus because in conflicts neither of you is very willing to give in. Your thinking and your logic will take you in different directions, so much so that it can disturb communication. Maybe in time you will learn to accept your partner's ideas and opinions; that would give this relationship a chance and could even make it exciting. You are both going to have to realize that there is more than just one truth."
1641;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819330;His Mercury in Square with her Venus;"Probably this relationship isn't a very happy one, because your partner will have the feeling that you don't take her needs seriously and she will feel that you are showing her the cold shoulder. Maybe you see things with analytical distance where she prefers to trust her gut feelings. You probably don't understand her need for harmony which is why she has trouble learning to have faith in your love. This is a difficult aspect; you should spend a lot of time discussing your problems to avoid anyone being hurt so deeply that it will destroy the relationship."
1642;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081474;His Mercury in Square with her Mars;Probably your arguments are often loud and temperamental. You may find your partner's way of doing things reckless and unwise, while she thinks you are boring and can't find a way to get closer to your spiritual essence. You give advice which she doesn't want to take, because it sounds to rational and uninteresting to her. Maybe she doesn't understand that a good book can be just as exciting and entertaining as a tennis match. It could be difficult for you to find the right compromises, but that is no reason to give up hope.
1643;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343618;His Mercury in Square with her Jupiter;You may often have problems because your healthy reason doesn't want to jam with your partner's view of the world. Maybe she is headstrong and won't give up trying to convince you of her truth, which really isn't for everyone. Maybe you are just too conservative to see things objectively and understand their relation within a larger context. Either way it probably won't be easy for you to get along with each other day in and day out, because you will always be finding out things about each other which you can't understand.
1644;SYNASTRIE_0000000001605762;His Mercury in Square with her Saturn;Most likely you feel being restricted by your partner because she can't accept your intellectual free will. She may subscribe to morals which you find outdated. Her security is your oppression. Also she won't be receptive to your ideas because she primarily sees the risks and negative consequences of any endeavor. On the other hand, she will have a hard time understanding how you feel because some things which you are convinced of don't seem to have any rational basis from her perspective. It can be difficult to resolve this problem, but the only way to approach it is by talking openly with each other with a lot of sensitivity.
1645;SYNASTRIE_0000000001867906;His Mercury in Square with her Uranus;Maybe the spark when you first met is what brought you together, but it is questionable whether this relationship can last. Maybe you are lacking understanding for your partner's unpredictable behavior and may demand more consistency than she can manage. You can have problems communicating due to stress and your hectic pace. Your partner may be apt to overwhelm you with all of her activities. She appreciates your creativity but you have trouble following her philosophy of life. You don't understand why anyone should think all the possibilities through before doing anything. This is a difficult aspect which will demand compromises from both sides.
1646;SYNASTRIE_0000000002130050;His Mercury in Square with her Neptune;Probably you feel that your partner is too rational and suffer because you can't share your romantic dreams with him. He doesn't stand a chance of understanding your visions and your imagination, preferring to trust in reason, he feels at home in reality. This will lead to conflicts which will end in disappointments. If both of you want to continue this relationship, you have to be more open to her inner world and judge life's situations by more than just facts and figures, while your partner has to make more of an effort to follow your train of thought and live in the present.
1647;SYNASTRIE_0000000002392194;His Mercury in Square with her Pluto;"Probably when the two of you fight all hell breaks loose; one can only hope that you don't go beyond tolerable limits. Your partner is going to be a constant challenge to your intellect and her will power will make yours seem weak in comparison. You will look for rational solutions to problems while she is concerned about instigating change at any price. Your efforts to understand her could lead you into dangerous areas, the best you can hope for is to be amazed at what you may discover. Although you remain fascinated by her, you are definitely in over your head. You may have a passionate relationship, but whether it will last is another question."
1648;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049282;His Mercury in Trine with her Sun;Here the woman will set the tone and her partner won't resist because it fits well into your lives together. A lot will depend on the kind of relationship the partner had to his mother as well as how they treat each other today. If he enjoyed letting her take care of him, he will want to be taken care of. Definitely there will be intellectual potential for a harmonious confrontation on this subject. You should be able to grow old together, unless other aspects of this horoscope indicate otherwise.
1649;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311426;His Mercury in Trine with her Moon;In this relationship you appreciate your discussions and the energetic way your partner communicates with you. He will be especially understanding when approaching subjects concerning your feminine emotions.

You both think pretty much the same way and you could develop a lot of good ideas together. You should find a creative purpose because both of you are very understanding and can animate each other to the highest achievements.
1651;SYNASTRIE_0000000000835714;His Mercury in Trine with her Venus;You should take on a creative goal, because this aspect will give you opportunities to communicate on all levels.

You are convinced that he is considerate of your needs and have enough confidence to open yourself to him. You will probably inspire him to get in contact with the world of beauty, at least in a spiritual sense.

1652;SYNASTRIE_0000000001097858;His Mercury in Trine with her Mars;She will have a very provocative influence on his thinking and can coax him out of hiding in many respects. You will complement each other well, because every time she is about to rush into something, he can make her aware of the consequences of her actions.

Together you can achieve a lot because you are both courageous and reflective, which are useful qualities for anything you do. Probably she will come up with the ideas, while he will provide the necessary energy to start putting things into action.
1653;SYNASTRIE_0000000001360002;His Mercury in Trine with her Jupiter;This is an excellent combination because here his practical thinking harmonizes with her way of seeing the world. She can get him to see the events going on around him more objectively and to understand them as part of a larger context, while he trains his eye for detail and makes sure that she doesn't leave anything important out of her consideration. Both will attain insights which would have been out of their reach without the other. Probably she will bring him to confront the more basic aspects of life while expanding his horizons to include philosophical and religious questions. She knows she can rely on him when it comes to applying ideas in concrete situations, but also when it comes to managing every day life.

1656;SYNASTRIE_0000000002146434;His Mercury in Trine with her Neptune;The man's logic will converge harmoniously with the woman's imagination. Through her he will probably come up with a lot of new ideas, because he will finally take the risk of deviating from the prescribed course now and then and will also place more trust in his intuition. He will also bring her to confront the trials and troubles of every day life, which will give her the opportunity to learn a lot of new things and may lead her to see the world more realistically. This aspect can be advantageous for both of you: she will train her logic and intellectual abilities while he will become mentally more open and judge situations on criteria other than numbers and facts.
1657;SYNASTRIE_0000000002408578;His Mercury in Trine with her Pluto;Probably your discussions aren't superficial, but you support each other in getting to the bottom of things.

This will give her partner the opportunity to unfold his creativity, which should be one of his most intimate wishes. He will express his appreciation with tenderness and will be well informed about his partner's preferences in this area. Still it will depend on the kind of relationships each had with their mothers and fathers and how the relationships have evolved. Are there any emotional scars just surfacing now? Try to become more aware of whether you see each other as a father or a mother, if so, you should definitely do something about it. If it gets to the point where you are accusing each other of being your parents, than it would be time to take a closer look at it. The way your are leading this relationship will lend itself to recognizing deeply rooted conflicts and finding solutions for them, naturally, provided that you are sufficiently interested in doing it.

1670;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524482;His Venus in Conjunction with her Mercury;There should be a lot of common interests in this relationship because the woman's rationality will be very compatible with his need for harmony. He probably admires her logic and likes to listen to her, because she never overlooks his needs and is willing to stand by him when he needs support. Both prefer the same artistic styles, thus you should have no problem to agree on a decor for your home.

1672;SYNASTRIE_0000000001048770;His Venus in Conjunction with her Mars;According to the classical gender roles, the woman will take on the part of the man, while the man will bring out his feminine side. Politically correct, it could be said that the woman has the greater energy and the man allows himself to be guided by her. This could work out fine as long as she is considerate of his feelings and he respects her need for harmony and lets himself get caught up in her drive for action. Probably your sex life is fulfilling because the mutual attraction is great. Even if you make your friends wonder, don't let that stop you from doing your thing.
1673;SYNASTRIE_0000000001310914;His Venus in Conjunction with her Jupiter;This aspect will promote both the emotions as well as the consciousness of both partners.

1674;SYNASTRIE_0000000001573058;His Venus in Conjunction with her Saturn;In this relationship mutual trust and security will play a great role.

1675;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835202;His Venus in Conjunction with her Uranus;"Probably you fell in love quickly; and you may have felt the sparks intensely. Your partner appreciates your spontaneity and is probably not looking for a relationship for a feeling of security, because that may be lacking here.

He will be attracted to your unique and lively character, this reassurance will be good for you. It will hardly be boring, you should be happy to be together and remain optimistic."

He is very receptive to her dreams and visions and sees them as an enrichment of his life. Maybe he will inspire her artistically.

You should treat each other tenderly with a lot of consideration; neither one of you has any reason to fear losing anything, and both of you give from your hearts. You can be very happy together, but you should watch out that you keep your feet firmly on the ground."
1677;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359490;His Venus in Conjunction with her Pluto;Your partner will change you and you won't struggle against it because it feels right. There is a great sexual attraction between you, setting a lot in motion. Through you your partner will learn to direct her strength and her will towards positive ambitions and to allow love and harmony to develop. You will take away some of her bitterness, in turn she will be a living example of how you can get your way in life. Together you can achieve a lot and eventually withstand crises unharmed, because you have learned that there are limits on how far you can go, even in a fight.
1678;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016578;His Venus in Opposition with her Sun;If this aspect ever comes up in a partnership horoscope it will be a relationship full of challenges and conflicts. Fulfilling mutual needs for love and sex can always lead to frustrating experiences. Maybe his needs won't be satisfied and she may not know how to live up to his image of her. Intense soul searching and great tolerance will be necessary if both of you are interested in continuing this relationship.

1679;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278722;His Venus in Opposition with her Moon;This relationship may contain some emotional conflicts. You have different ideas about harmony in a partnership. He may find her moody and suffer because she isn't able to satisfy his needs. On the other hand she may accuse him of being able put himself in the position of every one else and really understand them, and then having no understanding for her. Even if he tries he may have trouble getting close to her. This is a challenging aspect maybe resulting in disappointment. You should both approach your problems with a lot of sensitivity because there is a danger of hurting each other deeply.
1680;SYNASTRIE_0000000000540866;His Venus in Opposition with her Mercury;This is a very difficult aspect because your partner may have the feeling that although you take him seriously intellectually, you don't meet his emotional needs. Maybe he would like to show affection, while you are more interested in an intellectual exchange. Maybe you are overwhelmed by his need for affection while your female character remains hidden behind your exaggerated intellect. You may accuse him of not being able to approach subjects with any amount of rational objectivity and making decisions based only on emotion. No matter what happens you have to invest a lot of energy in your conflicts.
1681;SYNASTRIE_0000000000803010;His Venus in Opposition with her Venus;"With this aspect everything will depend on your sensitivity; how you recognize and respond to your partner's needs. Probably you have different ideas about love and togetherness, even your tastes in art will go in different directions. Still you could manage this aspect and learn a lot if you get more involved with each other and make compromises."
1682;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065154;His Venus in Opposition with her Mars;You will have a lot of interesting discussions about the male and female perspective of the world, and both of you could learn a lot. Probably you won't live by the traditional gender roles and will run into problems. You will be more vulnerable than your partner and should pull the emergency brake when you realize that things are no longer taking a constructive course. Your partner won't respond to your tenderness the way you are used to with other women. Maybe she would rather have a more energetic partner who does a lot. You have trouble coming to terms with your partner's strength, while she can't understand your need for harmony. This aspect is truly a challenge.
1683;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327298;His Venus in Opposition with her Jupiter;"Maybe your partner's world is too small for you and he suffers because he never has the feeling that you are there just for him, even for a short time. Your view of the world is made up of more freedom and tolerance than he is prepared to give you in the relationship. This is why it will be difficult to find a consensus. You aren't interested in stability and togetherness; but want to develop your own mind and he may just be in your way. You will see his affection and need for harmony as an obstruction to your search for the higher truth. If you want to continue the relationship, you will need to compromise."
1684;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589442;His Venus in Opposition with her Saturn;"Here your partner will do her best to make you feel guilty, just because you may not live up to her expectations of responsibility in this relationship. Sometimes you will feel that you are weaker than she is; in addition her determination and coolness put you off. On the other hand, she will often feel like she has to think and act for two. Before you can be really happy in this relationship, you both need to experience each other in order to find out how much mutual devotion is involved and what you are willing to sacrifice."
1685;SYNASTRIE_0000000001851586;His Venus in Opposition with her Uranus;With this opposition there will be a magnetic attraction between two people who probably have little in common. Your partner may have ideas about love, sex and romance which make you snicker, because they seem too conservative to you. The more your partner tries to get in touch with your unconventional personality, the more he will be aware of the differences between you. Because he may be fascinated by you, he could be torn between his desire to have you at his side and reality, which seems to indicate that he will never get what he wants.
1686;SYNASTRIE_0000000002113730;His Venus in Opposition with her Neptune;With this opposition you may be amazed to discover that you have been living an illusion. You may think that your partner understands what you mean by the words love, sex and romance, but some day your are going to find out that it isn't the case and she has been misleading you, which is all the more tragic because she has been believing it herself. Although you are attracted by her imagination and gentleness, in the end it will only confuse you. If these misunderstandings aren't cleared up, you will have trouble leading an honest and happy relationship.
1687;SYNASTRIE_0000000002375874;His Venus in Opposition with her Pluto;This aspect will demonstrate temperament and a lack of predictability to the extent, that it shouldn't be surprising if the relationship doesn't last very long. He will be put off by her displays of aggression, which may be expressed in a sexualized manner. Also his ideas about love and romance don't jive with hers, so that he will often withdraw in disappointment. Everywhere where Pluto is involved, there will be regeneration and transformation and if this aspect is challenging, you can use the friction it provides, to grow together.
1688;SYNASTRIE_0000000000032962;His Venus in Square with her Sun;If this aspect ever comes up in a partnership horoscope it will be a relationship full of challenges and conflicts. Fulfilling mutual needs for love and sex can always lead to frustrating experiences. Maybe his needs won't be satisfied and she may not know how to live up to his image of her. Intense soul searching and great tolerance will be necessary if both of you are interested in continuing this relationship. It will be important for this relationship to set a creative goal for the two of you and to work towards it.
1689;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295106;His Venus in Square with her Moon;Here the woman may try to mother her partner because that is what she considers being love. He feels suffocated by her attention and gets so confused that he doesn't know what he actually wants, because he has different needs from a friendship. It can be very difficult to bring your needs into harmony since with this aspect a lot will take place subconsciously. Both of you are going to have to make an effort to approach each other and talk about your hopes, wishes and dislikes. This will give your relationship a chance.
1690;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557250;His Venus in Square with her Mercury;"Probably this relationship isn't a very happy one, because your partner will have the feeling that you don't take his needs seriously and he will feel that you are showing him the cold shoulder. Maybe you see things with analytical distance where he prefers to trust his gut feelings. You probably don't understand his need for harmony which is why he has trouble learning to have faith in your love. This is a difficult aspect; you should spend a lot of time discussing your problems to avoid anyone being hurt so deeply that it will destroy the relationship."
1691;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819394;His Venus in Square with her Venus;This is a difficult aspect, because both of you have very different ideas about love, harmony and togetherness. Maybe he makes too many compromises in responding to her wishes, preventing her from taking him seriously. Or he demands proof of her affection she won't be able to give. Even if both partners are doing everything in their power, you may be crossing your emotional signals, meaning that you will have a lot of disappointments to withstand. Even your taste may not be compatible, thus it might be very difficult for you to be happy together.
1692;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081538;His Venus in Square with her Mars;Maybe your partner feels being oppressed and he may be confused because the classical gender roles are being questioned all of the sudden. He is more vulnerable than you are and should be the one to pull the emergency brake when things aren't taking a constructive course. You don't respond to his tenderness and affection as he would like. Maybe you find him too weak or think of him as a burden, who prevents you from leading your life the way you are used to. Your discussions will be very interesting and you can learn a lot about the way the world looks from both male and female perspectives. Whether you will be happy together is another matter.
1693;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343682;His Venus in Square with her Jupiter;You will have a tough time winning over your partner, because she is terrified of losing her independence and is afraid that she will have to give up all her freedom in order to enjoy love and security. Maybe your tenderness doesn't mean as much to her as you would like to believe. It will be a challenge for you to avoid restricting her and still get what you want out of the relationship. She may find that you lack intellectual flexibility and would like to hear you express more tolerance and a liberal view of the world in your conversations. The chances of living together in harmony could be increased if you would work on filling in some of the deficits in your education and were to pay more attention to her ideas.
1694;SYNASTRIE_0000000001605826;His Venus in Square with her Saturn;This is a difficult aspect because your partner will have a tendency to dominate and to restrict you. She is willing to take on all the responsibility for you, but expects to be respected for it. Even though you know that you can rely on her and appreciate it, you are often dissatisfied with the situation. She will have a hard time letting you loosen her up, even though it would give her more self-confidence. This is why this relationship is lacking life and spontaneity. What you really want is honest affection, but what you end up getting is security. Your partner should be aware that you are no longer a child and are capable of taking on responsibility. Once this has been cleared up, the relationship will probably be happier.
1695;SYNASTRIE_0000000001867970;His Venus in Square with her Uranus;Probably you fell in love quickly, but it will be doubtful if the relationship will last. Your ideas about freedom and togetherness are simply too different. Maybe she can't appreciate the affection he gives, but feels trapped in the relationship. If she shows herself the way she really is, her lack of predictability could make him suffer because he needs more warmth and sensitivity. It won't be easy to resolve this conflict to everyone's satisfaction, although that is no reason not to try.
1696;SYNASTRIE_0000000002130114;His Venus in Square with her Neptune;He will have a hard time understanding you, and in spite of all of his love and affection, he will never feel that he understands you and that you are someone he can rely on. Maybe you need his attention because you are unable to cope with life on your own. Also, you can confuse him so much that he won't know what he feels and will wonder why he ever wanted a relationship with you in the first place. Even if he finds you very attractive, he won't be able to get involved with you and share your dreams. You will feel insecure and won't believe that he loves you, and end up distorting everything in your mind until you aren't sure of anything anymore. You should talk about what is bothering you and think things through rationally, if nothing else helps.
1697;SYNASTRIE_0000000002392258;His Venus in Square with her Pluto;This relationship can quickly turn into a dependency leading to frustration. What he considers love and togetherness, is a suppression of natural instincts for her. She wants to have her own way no matter what, and may even look for other men if she has the feeling that she might be missing out on something. Probably the man has the weaker role in this relationship because he is more vulnerable than she is. She isn't just looking for harmony with him, but wants to experience all sorts of things. This relationship could be a tremendous challenge for both of you, but there is still a chance for personal growth if you can handle the crisis.
1698;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049346;His Venus in Trine with her Sun;Somehow one partner will feel obliged to dominate this relationship, still she will enjoy doing it because this will give her partner the opportunity to unfold his creativity. That should be one of his most intimate desires and he will thank her tenderly, knowing exactly how to please her. He will also be in a position to use all of his creativity to support her personal development. Because relationships often give a couple the opportunity to see each other as a mother and a father, you should consider whether that is the case with you and if it is, you should start to work through it constructively. The harmonious nature of this relationship supports confronting deep rooted conflicts, provided that there is a will to do this and that there are conflicts to be solved.
1699;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311490;His Venus in Trine with her Moon;This aspect will bring about extreme sensitivity in the way you treat each other. Your emotional world will be enriched by your partner's creative impulses. He will be in a position to sense your desires. Tenderness will play an important role in this relationship. He will constantly be coming up with new and different ways to surprise you in this respect. It is no wonder that you will be especially appreciative, therefore pleasing him as well. This romance can get very intense, in an atmosphere of harmony you may become one.
1700;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573634;His Venus in Trine with her Mercury;You should take on a creative goal, because this aspect will give you opportunities to communicate on all levels. It won't be difficult for you to find a way to delve into your partner's thoughts, because your need for harmony is compatible with her way of thinking. You are convinced that she is considerate of your needs and have enough confidence to open yourself to her. You will probably inspire her to get in contact with the world of beauty, at least in a spiritual sense. There should be a loving relationship between you which will be maintained by your common interests.
1701;SYNASTRIE_0000000000835778;His Venus in Trine with her Venus;This is a pleasant aspect providing harmony and understanding, because both of you will feel pretty much the same way. Each of you knows that you can rely on the other and don't have any inhibitions about showing your honest emotions. Even your taste in styles will be compatible, which is why there shouldn't be any arguments when you go out to buy new furniture. You should be happy together, unless other aspects indicate the opposite.
1702;SYNASTRIE_0000000001097922;His Venus in Trine with her Mars;You can make good use of your partner's energy and have no problems with her taking the lead. She is probably more active and more courageous than you are. In spite of that your relationship will be fine, because she will respond to your needs and likes to cuddle in front of the fireplace. Maybe she will encourage you to explore your artistic talents, while you can teach her how to relax and to take things as they come.
1703;SYNASTRIE_0000000001360066;His Venus in Trine with her Jupiter;Your need for harmony will be compatible with her way of seeing the world and both of you can give the other a lot, while leaving each other enough freedom to allow the relationship to last for a long time. She will animate you to think about the basic things in life and to look towards the future optimistically. In return, the affection she receives will make it easier for her to understand the true meaning of human nature and brotherly love. Most likely the two of you will be lucky enough to withstand life's challenges together.
1704;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622210;His Venus in Trine with her Saturn;"You are very happy to have a partner you can rely on, when it comes to making rational decisions. She will have no problem getting involved with you and respecting your emotions, because the affection you give her will replenish her strength. With her at your side, you can be honest about your emotions and even let yourself be vulnerable. This will enrich her life with both joy and tranquility. You will be able to lead a stable and reliable relationship; unless other factors in your horoscopes tell a different story."
1705;SYNASTRIE_0000000001884354;His Venus in Trine with her Uranus;"This constellation will keep your relationship in a state of constant renewal because together you will make a lot of interesting new discoveries. Your partner has to grant you a lot of freedom if he wants to hang on to you. In any case you will always be able to impress and inspire him with your ideas. He is simply open for your spontaneity; and may even be able to convince you to go along with him. His affection and tenderness will make you happy to be alive, and his reassurance concerning the changes in your life will be especially pleasant. Even if your relationship sometimes seems to be chaotic, this is a harmonious aspect which can turn out to be very nice when it is accompanied by a healthy portion of common sense."
1706;SYNASTRIE_0000000002146498;His Venus in Trine with her Neptune;"Your relationship should be very tender and will probably be open to other people's needs. You won't have any problems dreaming together and following your imagination wherever it leads you, because the energy flow between you will be as gentle as it is beautiful. You can create together and explore your artistic talents. Your strong sense of romance will bring you to spend a lot of wonderful hours together. Your partner's love will inspire you to share your visions with him; while he will let himself be guided through worlds which you have introduced him to. Intuitively both of you will sense the other's wishes, so that harmony will reign."
1707;SYNASTRIE_0000000002408642;His Venus in Trine with her Pluto;He will use his strength and will power to bring about changes in both of you. Maybe with your help he can overcome disappointments which have been bothering him. Your affection and trust will make him become more gentle and that will allow him to experience more joy in life. On the other hand you will get to know your strengths and will realize that you have access to a hidden energy source, that you can activate at anytime. Both of you will experience that love will conquer every inner crisis and that light only exists because there is darkness.
1708;SYNASTRIE_0000000000065730;His Venus in Sextile with her Sun;One partner will somehow feel obliged to dominate this relationship, and she will enjoy doing it because this will give her partner the opportunity to unfold his creativity.

1710;SYNASTRIE_0000000000590018;His Venus in Sextile with her Mercury;"You should set a creative goal for yourselves because this aspect will give you the opportunity to cooperate on all levels. The man won't have any trouble getting through to his partner while she understands her thoughts, because his need for harmony fits in nicely with her way of thinking.

1717;SYNASTRIE_0000000002425026;His Venus in Sextile with her Pluto;He will use his strength and will power to bring about changes in both of your lives. Maybe with your help he can overcome disappointments which have been bothering him. Your affection and trust will make him become more gentle and that will allow him to experience more joy in life.

Both of you will experience that love will conquer every inner crisis and that light only exists because there is darkness.
1718;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000258;His Mars in Conjunction with her Sun;With this aspect a man will be able to use his energies to help his partner's personal development. It will be very important to treat each other lovingly because of the inclination to practice forms of sexuality which are anything but tender. There may also be a drive to compete, which may tempt you to let your frustrations out on your partner. Both of you can be very determined, and there is nothing wrong with that. Direct your determination to a common goal, then you won't have any reason to make each other's lives unnecessarily difficult. It should actually be in everybody's interest to look for a partner to love and who is pleasant to be with, and not out of a need to intensify all kinds of unsolved conflicts.
1719;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262402;His Mars in Conjunction with her Moon;Here the sexual impulses will definitely come from the man, and the sign containing the man's Moon in his birth chart will be of special significance. If it is in a female sign, the sexual relationship will be of a nature which his partner will find very pleasant. If Mars is in a male sign, sex may be the subject of conflicts. In spite of this, if both of you pay attention to each other's needs, the conflicts should be productive, no matter what else happens. In the end the man should be in a position to use his energies to help his partner find an adequate expression for her creativity.
1720;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524546;His Mars in Conjunction with her Mercury;This is an exciting aspect because the woman's intellect will have a stimulating effect on her partner and will be a challenge to him. On the other hand she is going to have to keep up with all of his activities which may lead her to a new way of seeing things. This aspect will also be significant with respect to sex. Probably the man will take the initiative in this direction, which is alright with her. There will be a danger of letting the relationship get too intellectual, but if he lets himself get caught up in her enthusiasm for getting out and doing things, this relationship should have a good chance.
1721;SYNASTRIE_0000000000786690;His Mars in Conjunction with her Venus;You feel comfortable with the traditional gender roles and it should make for a happy relationship. She will create harmony, have good taste and make everything nice and cozy, while he will use his energy for the benefit of both, having a firm foundation to work from. This will bring stability into the relationship. Also your sex life should provide both of you with wonderful experiences, because your mutual attraction is so great that it can be assumed that each of you will be able to respond to the other's wishes.
1722;SYNASTRIE_0000000001048834;His Mars in Conjunction with her Mars;The two of you can motivate each other to the highest achievements. Your energies harmonize well together and you work with the same enthusiasm. Together you can be very successful, still need to watch out that you don't let the competition between you become excessive. That will only waste energy, which you could put to much better use. Also you tend to be rough on each other, but you will have to decide for yourselves how far you can let that go.
1723;SYNASTRIE_0000000001310978;His Mars in Conjunction with her Jupiter;Your way of seeing the world and your drive to attain insights will inspire your partner to develop activities and to set his goals a little higher. Probably you do a lot together and like to travel together. The partnership is very lively, still you both need to watch out that you don't overdo it and allow yourselves a rest once in a while. Your partner will be able to bring you back down to Earth and makes sure that you confront reality and work on something concrete, while you can teach him about the spiritual background and give his enthusiasm a purpose. If you are able to exchange ideas and learn from each other, this relationship may be very productive.
1724;SYNASTRIE_0000000001573122;His Mars in Conjunction with her Saturn;"You have a good grip on your partner's activities and can coordinate them or direct them towards a sensible goal. Most likely you are more mature and more reasonable than your partner, which can only help the relationship. He will have the feeling that he can rely on you; he is also willing to take your advice. That will give him secure footing providing him with the freedom he needs to play around, although it will also serve as foundation to build on. You two make a good team and if you are able to get caught up in your partner's enthusiasm and manage to be flexible and spontaneous, a stable and active relationship could be the result."
1725;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835266;His Mars in Conjunction with her Uranus;A lot should happen in your relationship and rest assured it will never be boring. It may not be easy for your partner to get seriously involved with you, because dependency makes her nervous. But if you have enough energy to keep trying, she will eventually recognize that you have no intention of chaining her up in this relationship. Probably your common activities will be new experiences for you. There will be more than just a romance between you, it will be true friendship and solidarity. Your partner's spontaneity will especially challenge you and allow you to discover your strength and courage.
1726;SYNASTRIE_0000000002097410;His Mars in Conjunction with her Neptune;This is an interesting conjunction, enabling you to keep your temper under control and to become more sensitive. Your partner in turn will profit from your energy and may be inspired to set some concrete goals for herself. If you can avoid treating her roughly and are considerate of her sensitivity, both of your lives will be enriched by the other. Your partner will be able to overcome her inhibitions and face life with courage, while you may be confronted with another person's dreams and imagination for the first time, which will lead you to discover a new world.
1727;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359554;His Mars in Conjunction with her Pluto;Together you will have an unbelievable amount of energy you shouldn't waste. If you both make sure to be careful and not overdo it you could be very successful. You can live out your passions in bed. Maybe you can get your partner out of his shell and help him to recognize his strength and courage. He can help you to work through your disappointments making you very happy. Your relationship will be temperamental, still you should try not to overstep certain boundaries.
1728;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016642;His Mars in Opposition with her Sun;Both of you will become aware of each other's differences sooner or later because this aspect represents a challenge. It may be difficult for one of you to live up to the other's expectations. The way both of you behave in bed will reveal how much love is at stake. If you are using each other to let off steam, it may be acceptable for the time being. Although whether it can serve as a foundation for a lasting relationship will depend on your determination.
1729;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278786;His Mars in Opposition with her Moon;Here there is a danger of recklessly ignoring your partner's feelings and hurting her deeply. Maybe you want to dominate her by any means possible and don't give her a chance to show you who she really is. You think of her as being weak and try to provoke her to become aware of her strengths. Still these games won't help her because she is looking for a feeling of security not competition. You should really be a little more caring and try to understand the way she feels, if you want this relationship to have a chance. On the other hand she could let herself get caught up in your ideas and try to live life more courageously.
1730;SYNASTRIE_0000000000540930;His Mars in Opposition with her Mercury;"With this opposition you can count on intense conflicts. Maybe you have sexual needs which your intellectual partner isn't able to fulfill. You throw yourself into life, while she takes time to consider before doing anything. Your drive to keep busy will be obstructed by her attitude, just as she will have problems dealing with your energy. The resulting conflicts could be very turbulent; both of you should take care not to hurt the other."
1731;SYNASTRIE_0000000000803074;His Mars in Opposition with her Venus;You live according to traditional gender roles, probably to such an extreme that it can cause problems. You will miss tenderness, because your partner will believe that he has to play the part of the macho. Even if your nights are passionate, that won't be enough to keep your relationship harmonious in the long run. He should learn to show his feelings and to become softer, while she has to be more independent and should start looking for her identity. You should try to get closer and offer each other support in order to develop a relationship based on equality.
1732;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065218;His Mars in Opposition with her Mars;Probably this opposition causes problems. You can often get caught up in a kind of rivalry where each of you is determined to realize your own goals. Unfortunately it could turn into a bitter competition. Maybe you will waste your energy proving yourself and demonstrating your success to the other. You should learn to work with your partner, because together you can achieve a lot. Maybe you actually don't really want to constantly challenge each other and suffer under mechanisms which are difficult to change.
1733;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327362;His Mars in Opposition with her Jupiter;You will fight your partner's independent consciousness and won't even be willing to listen to her. It may come to power struggles where she will fight with words while you counter with quick action, hurting her more than you realize. Unfortunately these conflicts won't be productive until you are able to reach compromises. You won't even consider her ideas and she won't be able to deal with your energy. If you aren't able to come to terms with her, she isn't going to hang around for long. Then you will probably be disappointed and feel humiliated, while she will be happy to have freed herself from your chains.
1734;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589506;His Mars in Opposition with her Saturn;Your partner will feel that his drive is being restricted and won't be willing to accept your advice. You are probably more mature and more reasonable, so that it would only make sense for him to listen to you. Sometimes he wishes that you were as enthusiastic as he is and could overcome your inhibitions about simply jumping up and doing something. Both of you have to realize that you would make a good team together. Your partner has the courage while you have the stamina and are serious enough to carry something out to its successful completion. Both of you should admit to your strengths and weaknesses, if you want the relationship to last. Most importantly your partner will need plenty of freedom to learn from his own mistakes and should appreciate being able to rely on you.
1735;SYNASTRIE_0000000001851650;His Mars in Opposition with her Uranus;Your partnership will never be boring and may even be restless at times. You will try to win this woman's affection and find a way to get through to her unapproachable nature, although her love of freedom may be stronger and win out in the end. Maybe she would rather be your good friend than your lover, which won't stop you from trying and investing every ounce of energy you have. If you can't let go and wait until she comes on her own, the end could be disappointing for both of you, but that might make you see how much you mean to her. You should take her ideas more seriously, that will make her happy.
1736;SYNASTRIE_0000000002113794;His Mars in Opposition with her Neptune;He will invest all his energy in the relationship and he definitely wants to get closer to her, although she may still like to pull away from him, because she isn't sure what she actually wants. There could be a lot of confusion, in which one might deceive the other, without even being aware of it. He is fascinated by her imagination and will have to come to realize that this is what is causing a lot of the problems. Maybe she finds him unrefined and is even afraid of him. If both of you would get closer to each other, he could come up with the necessary sensitivity, while she may find out how to realize her dreams.
1737;SYNASTRIE_0000000002375938;His Mars in Opposition with her Pluto;Probably things are pretty explosive around you, because both of you will have a hard time accepting the other person's will. Maybe you fight a lot, even to the extent where physical violence breaks out. It wouldn't be surprising if you end up in bed afterwards. Both of you should learn to keep your ego under control in order to give this relationship a chance. She would like to change this, but he is fighting it tooth and nail. She has a special talent for seeing through his motives, which only serves to make him more aggressive. Pull the emergency brake before one of you gets hurt so badly that it can't be healed.
1738;SYNASTRIE_0000000000033026;His Mars in Square with her Sun;Both of you will become aware of each other's differences sooner or later because this aspect represents a challenge. It may be difficult for one of you to live up to the other's expectations. Here the sexual behavior between the two of you will reveal how much love is at stake. If you are using each other to work off steam, it may be acceptable for the time being. Although if it can serve as a foundation for a lasting relationship will depend on your determination.
1739;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295170;His Mars in Square with her Moon;You are probably fixed on traditional roles, which can have a negative impact on your sex life. Your partner may try to dominate, and you think that you have to accept that because you are a woman, although you don't feel comfortable with it. At worst it can characterize a partnership of fear and distrust, but you don't have to let things get that far. Talk about your desires and longings and be willing to compromise, that never hurt anyone.
1740;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557314;His Mars in Square with her Mercury;Probably your arguments are often loud and temperamental. You may find your partner's way of doing things reckless and unwise, while he thinks you are boring and can't find a way to get closer to your spiritual essence. You give advice which he doesn't want to take, because it sounds to rational and uninteresting to him. Maybe he doesn't understand that a good book can be just as exciting and entertaining as a tennis match. It could be difficult for you to find the right compromises, but that is no reason to give up hope.
1741;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819458;His Mars in Square with her Venus;Her femininity and his masculinity will confront each other and create a lot of confusion. It may be that you will spend many nights in passion, but if you can coordinate your every day lives is questionable. You live the classic gender roles so extremely that you may end up not feeling comfortable with it. Maybe the man is convinced that he will expose himself too much and look silly if he were to show his emotions, while the woman has no chance to develop her strengths and considers herself weak. You will have very interesting discussions and arguments, and you can learn a lot about the way the world looks from both male and female perspectives. Whether you will be happy together is another matter.
1742;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081602;His Mars in Square with her Mars;Your energy forms don't harmonize with each other, which can cause a lot of problems. It is almost as if you tanked up with different kinds of fuel, making your lives run completely differently. It may even come to uncontrollable aggression and no one can find the emergency brake. Each of you may feel that you have to mobilize all your strength in order to stand up to the other, which is probably why you are so competitive. Before you waste more energy, you should take time to think seriously about your future together.
1743;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343746;His Mars in Square with her Jupiter;Here you will do everything you can to capture this woman, although you hardly stand a chance of succeeding. The way she sees things will challenge you to use every ounce of your energy, and may even provoke you into making a fool of yourself. You can't understand her thirst to attain insights and search for the truth, but it usually makes you feel challenged somehow. Maybe she will let you know that she thinks you are intellectually inferior, which will make you furious. There will be problems and you need all the strength you have to solve them, otherwise the relationship won't stand a chance.
1744;SYNASTRIE_0000000001605890;His Mars in Square with her Saturn;If you can manage to meet each other half way, you could learn a lot from each other. He will have a hard time following her advice, because he is convinced that it would be in effect a submission to her will. Although a little guidance wouldn't do him any harm, but would allow him to coordinate his strength and work for a sensible goal. Maybe she approaches him awkwardly when she wants to criticize him, only provoking him to perform stunts which won't impress her anyway. He is brave, but she has the maturity to make sensible decisions, so that both of you could be successful, if you would only accept each other.
1745;SYNASTRIE_0000000001868034;His Mars in Square with her Uranus;Although his desire for her is almost overwhelming, he has a terrible time getting involved with her. She likes to pull away from him, which provokes him to extreme reactions but these do not impress her at all. Her lack of predictability may even make him aggressive. The atmosphere between the two is probably always tense. He finds her impersonal and reserved, but the pressure he constantly exerts on her won't get him anywhere. He should be more relaxed and grant her enough freedom that she can willingly come to him some day.
1746;SYNASTRIE_0000000002130178;His Mars in Square with her Neptune;Maybe she will confuse him so much that he will wear himself out trying to understand her and to impress her, which doesn't even promise to be very successful. He could waste his energy trying to find out her secrets, because she really holds an attraction for him and arouses his imagination. She doesn't know how to deal with his energy and courage and finds him rough and unmannered. She also can't accept the way he thinks because he wants to be the boss and might decide to draw her out of her dream world. If this relationship is supposed to last, she needs to learn to trust his sense of reality while he will have to respect her sensitivity.
1747;SYNASTRIE_0000000002392322;His Mars in Square with her Pluto;Both of you are afraid of missing something if you should decide to get involved with the other and commit yourself. She can see right through his motives and finds him too primitive at times, because she has her own ambitions, which she pursues with all her power. Both egos are very strong and unwilling to compromise. Maybe sex is the only thing you can agree on, but that is no basis for a long-term harmonious relationship. He may want to conquer her, but she isn't the right kind of woman. Senseless power struggles could make up a part of your daily agenda. If this relationship is supposed to last, you should learn to compromise.
1748;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049410;His Mars in Trine with her Sun;With this aspect your partner will use his energies to support your personal development. A loving atmosphere will be very important because you may be prone to sexual practices which are characterized by anything but tenderness. Thanks to the harmonious nature of this aspect, that shouldn't be such a great problem or at least will let itself be transformed into something positive. There may be some competition between you because both of you will be very determined. Still there should be an opportunity to direct your determination towards a common goal, leading to an active and harmonious partnership.
1749;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311554;His Mars in Trine with her Moon;Here the sexual impulses will definitely come from the man. Thanks to the harmonious nature of this aspect, he will have the capacity to approach her just the way she likes. She will feel secure with him and will motivate him to the highest achievements. Her needs are important to him and he never seems to run out of energy when he is reading her desires in her eyes. This enables him to help her find an adequate expression for her creativity.
1750;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573698;His Mars in Trine with her Mercury;He will have a very provocative influence on her thinking and can coax her out of hiding in many respects. You will complement each other well, because every time he is about to rush into something, she can make him aware of the consequences of his actions. This will make your partnership all the more interesting and will bring the two of you closer together because she will understand his drive for action and occasionally let herself get caught up in it. Together you can achieve a lot because you are both courageous and reflective, which are useful qualities for anything you do. Probably she will come up with the ideas, while he will provide the necessary energy to start putting things into action.
1751;SYNASTRIE_0000000000835842;His Mars in Trine with her Venus;You can make good use of your partner's energy and have no problems with him taking the lead. He is probably more active and more courageous than you are. In spite of that your relationship will be fine, because he will respond to your needs and likes to cuddle in front of the fireplace. Your sex life should also be free of conflicts. Maybe he will encourage you to explore your artistic talents, while you can bring him to relax and to take things as they come.
1752;SYNASTRIE_0000000001097986;His Mars in Trine with her Mars;Your energy forms harmonize well together and you will get control of your lives in a similar manner. You will give each other strength and courage, neither one of you should be stronger or weaker than the other. You want to develop yourselves and seek your fortune independently of each other. It would be good if you could direct your energy towards a common goal. Probably the danger that the two of you will start seriously competing with each other is minimal. This relationship can be an opportunity for both of you to grow. Since you won't hesitate to take the initiative whenever necessary, you should stay together for a long time.
1753;SYNASTRIE_0000000001360130;His Mars in Trine with her Jupiter;Both of you will find the relationship exciting, this will lead to many common activities. You will give each other enough space, having never intended to restrict the other in any way. The intellectual background you provide will animate your partner to question the purpose of his activities. You will expand his consciousness so that he can look for constructive things to do, which will also benefit you. His courage and energy can be contagious, helping you to manage every day life and not get stuck in theory. All in all you will complement each other nicely.
1754;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622274;His Mars in Trine with her Saturn;You have certain expectations on a partnership, and your partner will have no problems fulfilling them with his level of energy. He knows that he can rely on you while you will make sure that the relationship is stable. Whenever he starts to worry about tomorrow, you create a calm atmosphere. You will influence him, but he will never let you reprimand or oppress him. The way you contemplate combined with your partner's drive to get out and do things will enable the two of you to build a firm foundation. He will initiate changes in your life, which will make you very happy and may even let him open himself even more. You should make a good team.
1755;SYNASTRIE_0000000001884418;His Mars in Trine with her Uranus;Her lack of predictability will challenge you to put every ounce of your energy to the test. You will never stop trying to win her, although you don't know if you will ever succeed. Her wealth of ideas and your drive to stay active will allow both of you to take on ambitious projects. You need to learn to live with the fact that she needs a lot of freedom. She knows what is right for her and she doesn't let anybody tell her otherwise, but you shouldn't have any problems with that, because it is her independence that you find so attractive.
1756;SYNASTRIE_0000000002146562;His Mars in Trine with her Neptune;This Sextile will combine the man's drive with the woman's imagination. She will make his world more colorful, while he will notice details he may have overlooked earlier. He, in turn, will show her how to make her dreams and visions come true and how to get her way. Through her, he will become more sensitive while she will gain strength. Whenever she is down, he can bring her back to life and restore her courage, helping him out as much as her, because it brings him into contact with new ideas.
1757;SYNASTRIE_0000000002408706;His Mars in Trine with her Pluto;"She will change him and bring out energy reserves, he didn't know he had to his disposal, because she will be constantly challenging him. He will enable her to experience more joy in life and let her take on concrete goals. There is such a strong attraction between you that the relationship will probably center around passionate sex. She will bring him to ask questions he never asked before; possibly he will experience things provoking him to revise the way he sees the world. He will show her how to live in the here and now as well as how to free herself of disappointments from the past."
1758;SYNASTRIE_0000000000065794;His Mars in Sextile with her Sun;With this aspect your partner will use his energies to support your personal development. A loving atmosphere will be very important because you may be prone to sexual practices which are characterized by anything but tenderness. Thanks to the harmonious nature of this aspect, that shouldn't be such a great problem or at least will let itself be transformed into something positive.

1760;SYNASTRIE_0000000000590082;His Mars in Sextile with her Mercury;Your partner will have a very provocative influence on your thinking and can bring you out of your shell in different ways. The two of you complement each other well, because whenever he is set on moving into something without thinking things through first, you can make him aware of the consequences of his actions. There will always be something going on, and all of this activity will serve to bring you closer together, because you will be able to come to terms with his drive for action and let yourself be caught up in it at times to the extent where you will even go along on occasion. Together you could accomplish a lot because you are both courageous and reflective. These qualities are useful in anything you do. Probably you will come up with the ideas, while he has the necessary energy to instigate their realization.
1761;SYNASTRIE_0000000000852226;His Mars in Sextile with her Venus;You can make good use of your partner's energy and have no problems with him taking the lead.

Both of you can grow in this partnership and lead a relationship which will last a long time, because you won't hesitate to take the initiative again and again.
1763;SYNASTRIE_0000000001376514;His Mars in Sextile with her Jupiter;Both of you will find the relationship exciting, this will lead to many common activities.

1766;SYNASTRIE_0000000002162946;His Mars in Sextile with her Neptune;This Sextile will combine the man's drive with the woman's imagination. She will make his world more colorful, while he pays attention to details he may have overlooked earlier. He, in turn, will show her how to make her dreams and visions come true and what she has to do to get her way. Through her, he will become more sensitive while she gains strength. Whenever she is down, he can bring her back to life and restore her courage, which will help him out as much as her, because it confronts him with new ideas.
1767;SYNASTRIE_0000000002425090;His Mars in Sextile with her Pluto;"She will change him and bring energy reserves to the surface he didn't know he had to his disposal, because she will be constantly challenging him. This will enable him to give her more joy in life and let her take on concrete goals. There is such a strong attraction between you that the relationship is probably centered around passionate sex. He will ask questions he never asked before; possibly he will experience things getting him to revise the way he sees the world. He will show her how to live in the here and now as well as how to free herself of old disappointments."
1768;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000322;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Sun;"The effects of this aspect will be dependent on both of your wishes and needs as well as on the state of the personal development of each of you. If a woman feels driven to express her individuality, her partner should support her; he will have ample opportunity to do this. He should make sure that he treats her with understanding and he should reflect deeply to find out what is good for her. All of us know all too well where that will eventually lead. Basically this aspect is supposed to promote harmony and enthusiasm. If you both recognize your needs and make concessions to each other, both of you will learn to give your partner all the freedom necessary to make the relationship pleasant."
1769;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262466;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Moon;With this aspect the male part will provide his partner with expanding impulses. He will allow her to express her feelings for him in every possible form. He will also want to protect her, although he should be aware of the limitations of protection. It may make more sense for him to find out how she can help herself to promote this development. There has to be a golden mean somewhere, providing both of you with a long lasting relationship. The combination between her emotional world and his expanding tendencies should lead to an atmosphere allowing you to live together peacefully.
1770;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524610;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Mercury;This conjunction will enable a synthesis of theory and practice. She supports her partner in his efforts to realize his abstract ideas. Both have a great thirst for knowledge in different directions, but which complement each other. She can have problems taking care of small problems of her every day life and may keep her attention on detail, while he prefers to strive for a comprehensive, intellectual world from a distance. This will allow both to profit from each other.
1771;SYNASTRIE_0000000000786754;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Venus;This aspect will promote both the emotions as well as the consciousness of both partners. She will be able to give him a lot of affection, creating an atmosphere in which he can trust her enough to open himself and tell her about his ideas and the way he sees the world. This will expand her horizons, and she will know how to appreciate that. It should be easy for both of you to really get to know each other and to get involved in each other's lives. Mutual good will and tenderness will play an important role in this relationship, that's why it could last a long time.
1772;SYNASTRIE_0000000001048898;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Mars;Your way of seeing the world and your drive to attain insights will inspire your partner to develop activities and to set her goals a little higher. Probably you do a lot together and like to travel together. The partnership is very lively, still you both need to watch out that you don't overdo it and allow yourselves a rest once in a while. Your partner will be able to bring you back down to Earth and to make sure that you confront reality and work on something concrete, while you can teach her about the spiritual background and give her enthusiasm a purpose. If you are able to exchange ideas and learn from each other, this relationship may be very productive.
1773;SYNASTRIE_0000000001311042;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Jupiter;"You have the same spiritual consciousness and could grow in the relationship. There shouldn't be any insurmountable problems, because the outlook on life which you share has rules regulating the way people should live together, which you both take seriously. You replenish each other's optimism; each makes the other happy to be alive. Probably when you go out together your attraction to each other shows. Neither of you worry unnecessarily; both of you value fun and you share the joy of travelling together. Each of you will have to expand your horizons, whereby your partner may be very helpful."
1774;SYNASTRIE_0000000001573186;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Saturn;Anytime your partner wants to overstep boundaries, you will prevent him from doing so. This relationship will have a drive for expansion and enthusiasm for life which includes being reasonable and taking obligations seriously. This combination will keep you in balance. You should try not to restrict him too much, because he could react defiantly. If you could accept some of his ideas wholeheartedly and without reservations, it would make him very happy. In turn he should know how to appreciate being able to rely on you and also listen to you on occasion. This relationship will have good chances, because it is light as well as serious.
1775;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835330;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Uranus;Probably you have a lot of great ideas together, which will certainly include humor. This aspect will stimulate both of you intellectually. Both of you love a good discussion and like being together with people, so you probably have a large circle of friends. Probably you don't intend to put each other in chains, because you are both progressive and enlightened. She can teach him about freedom and tolerance in human interaction, while she will find out that the consciousness doesn't have to be restricted by boundaries. This is a wonderful aspect, and if you both keep your feet on the ground, your relationship will be rewarded with fruitful insights.
1776;SYNASTRIE_0000000002097474;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Neptune;You probably get along nicely, because she has a talent for intuitively feeling her partner's consciousness. Without a lot of words she will come to understand how he sees the world and his role in it, which can help to avoid a lot of conflicts. She will inspire him to search for new insights. What will make him especially happy is that he never has to worry about being bored and the fact that she shares her world of dreams with him. He is open for her, because he recognizes the value of her visions. This synthesis of imagination and the search for truth will allow both of you to grow.
1777;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359618;His Jupiter in Conjunction with her Pluto;Here you will sometimes be able to cheer up your partner when she is depressed, and maybe even give her the courage to face life again. She will let herself fall deeply into her consciousness, but through you the way to get there won't be as dark and will have more meaning. Together you can regenerate all of her strength again. Thinking about your motivation will bring her to see the world in new ways which will make her more optimistic. You will get to know your strengths and will add depth to your thoughts. Through her you will be able to internalize the returning cycles of life.
1778;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016706;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Sun;In the negative sense of this aspect one of you may feel overwhelmed by the other, although with a tendency to expand, your partner may see this as an enrichment to her life. Fundamental differences may arise when it comes to the question of how a life together in today's society should be. If you can avoid an escalation of this conflict and secure individual freedom and independence, this relationship can be led with creativity. Participating in activities and setting goals together will help you to find each other.
1779;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278850;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Moon;"This is a challenging aspect because the man's drive for freedom can make his partner feel insecure. Her world is too small for him; he is curious and open for new developments. His thoughts are occupied with philosophy and ethics, while she prefers to take care of the smaller problems of every day life. His basic mood is more optimistic than hers and it takes her a lot longer to get over an insult or a disappointment. Maybe she will accuse him of not being interested in her personality, preferring to go out and be with a crowd of people rather than staying at home with her. If you want to resolve your conflicts in this respect, you are going to have to put in a lot of effort."
1780;SYNASTRIE_0000000000540994;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Mercury;"There could be problems because your view of the world just doesn't jam with your partner's practical thinking. Maybe you find her to be too conservative and would like her to look at life more objectively and understand the larger context of things. On the other hand, she finds you superficial because according to her, you never bother with details. This may result in communication problems. You will probably start pursuing new interests frequently and are intellectually more flexible than your partner; it could be good for her to partially adopt your attitude towards life."
1781;SYNASTRIE_0000000000803138;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Venus;"Maybe your partner's world is too small for you and she suffers because she never has the feeling that you are there just for her, even for a short time. Your view of the world is made up of more freedom and tolerance than she is prepared to give you in the relationship. This is why it will be difficult to find a consensus. You aren't interested in stability and togetherness; but want to develop your mind and she may just be in your way. You will see her affection and need for harmony as an obstruction to your search for the higher truth. If you want to continue the relationship, you will need to compromise."
1782;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065282;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Mars;You will fight your partner's independent consciousness and won't even be willing to listen to him. It may come to power struggles where he will fight with words while you counter with quick action, hurting him more than you realize. Unfortunately these conflicts won't be productive until you are able to reach compromises. You won't even consider his ideas and he won't be able to deal with your energy. If you aren't able to come to terms with him, he isn't going to hang around for long. Then you will probably be disappointed and feel humiliated, while he will be happy to have freed himself from your chains.
1783;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327426;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Jupiter;With this opposition two different worlds will collide, and if you don't watch out, you will waste all your energy trying to convince each other of your positions. Each of you needs a certain amount of autonomy and independence, still it's not easy for either of you to grant your partner the same freedom you would like to have. This aspect may promote your personal development, but you will need more respect for each other, focus more of your attention on the other's positive sides and offer more support.
1784;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589570;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Saturn;"Probably the man has restricted his partner somewhat, because she doesn't think as freely as he does. He needs a certain amount of independence, tolerance and honesty while she prefers to hang on to traditional values out of fear of change. Here two adverse philosophies will collide. She is willing to take on responsibility for a life together and to offer her partner security and constancy, but that isn't enough for him. His world is simply larger than hers; he is curious and wants new experiences, while she doesn't want to go along. He may be unwilling to commit himself and may be hurting her. You should recognize that you would make a great team if you could recognize each other's qualities."
1785;SYNASTRIE_0000000001851714;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Uranus;This opposition will create a lot of turmoil and dissatisfaction in the partnership. Maybe no one is willing to allow enough warmth and closeness to develop to give your relationship a foundation of trust. It will be hard for both of you to open yourself to the other and to sacrifice a bit of freedom. Maybe he has to criticize her constantly which causes her to back away. It would help you to discover what you have in common that you can build on. Conversations and even fights between you are sure to be lively, but you should try to reach a consensus.
1786;SYNASTRIE_0000000002113858;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Neptune;The man will try to do everything he can to understand his partner, because she fascinates him and holds a strong attraction for him. Still he probably won't get behind the mystery of her thoughts since her mind functions in a completely different way. Her reality doesn't have a lot in common with his, and she places a lot of value on her dreams and visions. He tries to sort her emotional experiences into pigeon holes, but won't be very successful. Sometimes he has the feeling that she has gotten him confused, to the point where he can't keep up his outlook on life, still that will happen much too often for it to be productive or exciting. She should take a serious look at his system of values, while he should learn to respect her way of thinking and feeling. This will give the relationship a chance.
1787;SYNASTRIE_0000000002376002;His Jupiter in Opposition with her Pluto;In your partnership there will probably be a lot of fighting or undercurrents of resentment. Two contradictory attitudes on life will battle against each other. While the world is bright and interesting for him, she sees more dark tones. She is very strong and has a will power which is so amazing that it scares him. He is looking for lightness and wants to live his life according to humanistic ideals, while she is fighting with herself and may consider him superficial. Happiness and pain will come together here, but it will be difficult for both of you to recognize that one will bring the other with it. If she continues to try to change him or even to control him, she is going to lose him.
1788;SYNASTRIE_0000000000033090;His Jupiter in Square with her Sun;In the negative sense of this aspect one of you may feel overwhelmed by the other, although with a tendency to expand, your partner may see this as an enrichment to her life. Here his intentions toward her won't be so important. However in time there may be fundamental differences when it comes to the question of how a life together in today's society should be. If you can avoid an escalation of this conflict and secure individual freedom and independence, this relationship can last as long as there is creative input. Participating in activities and setting goals together will help you to find each other.
1789;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295234;His Jupiter in Square with her Moon;"Probably you don't feel as secure with your partner as you would like. Your partner needs his freedom and is much more open for new experiences. Maybe he loves to travel while you prefer to stay at home. He is interested in spiritual and philosophical subjects and you perceive the world through your feelings, therefore your discussions can be very intense and often end in an argument. You have the feeling that he can never really respect you, which is probably right. Although if you try to ""chain"" your partner to you, it would rob the relationship of a lot of its value."
1790;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557378;His Jupiter in Square with her Mercury;You may often have problems because your healthy reason doesn't want to jam with your partner's view of the world. Maybe he is headstrong and won't give up trying to convince you of his truth, which really isn't for everyone. Maybe you are just too conservative to see things objectively and understand their relation within a larger context. Either way it probably won't be easy for you to get along with each other day in and day out, because you will always be finding out things about each other which you can't understand.
1791;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819522;His Jupiter in Square with her Venus;You will have a tough time winning over your partner, because he is terrified of losing his independence and is afraid that he will have to give up all his freedom in order to enjoy love and security. Maybe your tenderness doesn't mean as much to him as you would like to believe. It will be a challenge for you to avoid restricting him and still get what you want out of the relationship. He may find that you lack intellectual flexibility and would like to hear you express more tolerance and a liberal view of the world in your conversations. The chances of living together in harmony could be increased if you would work on filling in some of the deficits in your education and were to pay more attention to his ideas.
1792;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081666;His Jupiter in Square with her Mars;Here you will do everything you can to capture this man, although you hardly stands a chance of succeeding. The way he sees things will challenge you to use every ounce of your energy, and may even provoke you into making a fool of yourself. You can't understand his thirst to attain insights and search for the truth, but it usually makes you feel challenged somehow. Maybe he will let you know that he thinks you are intellectually inferior, which will make you furious. There will be problems and you need all the strength you have to solve them, otherwise the relationship won't stand a chance.
1793;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343810;His Jupiter in Square with her Jupiter;This is a difficult aspect, because not only do both of you have different outlooks on life but you also try to force them on each other. There will probably be heated discussions on questions of religion, ethics and philosophy, but neither of you will be willing to make concessions. If you want to stay together, you need to learn the value of intellectual freedom, tolerance and compromise, otherwise the constant conflicts will be unbearable for you. You can cause each other to grow, but each of you has to recognize that there isn't just one truth.
1794;SYNASTRIE_0000000001605954;His Jupiter in Square with her Saturn;Maybe your partner defends liberal, progressive ideas in order to gain your approval. In the relationship his drive for expansion and your hold on tradition will collide and cause friction. If you would just listen to each other, you could learn a lot and complement one another. The problem is that neither of you wants to come down from your pedestal and hold your own truth for the only valid one. If the relationship is supposed to last, your partner must learn to accept your limits and to make an effort to take responsibility for his behavior, while it would do you good to let yourself enjoy the pleasant side of life and not always be so serious.
1795;SYNASTRIE_0000000001868098;His Jupiter in Square with her Uranus;Maybe he allows himself to compare her actions with her words and to call attention to the discrepancies between them, although she can't bear it. She may accuse him of being too theoretical lacking pragmatic skills. In her view his ideas are so old-fashioned that they bear no relevance to the world of today. Here different outlooks on life will collide, and because neither of you likes to give in, you will have frequent arguments. Possibly he will find her approach impersonal, because she always runs off when he wants to have an important discussion. He is looking for a reasonable partnership, while for him, its not just her who counts, but also her many friends. It won't be easy to find a constructive solution to this dilemma.
1796;SYNASTRIE_0000000002130242;His Jupiter in Square with her Neptune;If he doesn't make more of an effort to be open with his partner and show tolerance, there could be problems. He could tend to see all her diverse ideas and fantasies as part of a system, which restricts her creativity. It could cause confusion, where no one will know why the relationship got started in the first place and where it should be heading. Maybe he is self-righteous and isn't willing to take her individuality seriously. She feels restricted, but doesn't know what she should do, because she usually tries to avoid open conflicts. The survival chances of this relationship will depend on both partner's willingness to compromise.
1797;SYNASTRIE_0000000002392386;His Jupiter in Square with her Pluto;Probably you are a lot less complicated than your partner and don't understand why anyone should torment themselves searching for insights the way she does. You would love to simply have fun together, but she is too caught up with her own thoughts and too concerned with the past to relax and enjoy herself. Maybe she considers you to be superficial and foolish because she hasn't yet experienced that people often don't recognize the truth until they have given up searching. She is convinced that every development has to be fought for, and she feels you aren't interested enough. Misunderstandings and conflicts could be the result.
1798;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049474;His Jupiter in Trine with her Sun;"This aspect will enable you to recognize your partner's wishes, which will contribute substantially to the development of her personality. You will be able to support her when it comes to finding an appropriate expression of her individuality; and you will be presented with plenty of opportunity. Your actions towards her will be characterized by a deep sense of good will, although you will know from deep inside what is good for her, you will never force your advice on her.

This aspect will generally promote harmony and enthusiasm in a relationship. You should have no trouble recognizing your needs and admitting them to each other, so that you can learn to give the other the necessary freedom to make the relationship pleasant."
1799;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311618;His Jupiter in Trine with her Moon;With this aspect the male part will provide his partner with impulses which may expand her horizons. He will allow her to express her feelings for him in every possible form. He will also want to protect her, although he should be aware of the limitations of protection. It may make more sense for him to find out what she can do to promote this development. There has to be a golden mean somewhere, which will allow both of you to build a long lasting relationship. The combination between her emotional world and his expanding tendencies should lead to an atmosphere which will allow you to live together peacefully.
1800;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573762;His Jupiter in Trine with her Mercury;This is an excellent combination because here her practical thinking harmonizes with his way of seeing the world. He can get her to see the events going on around him more objectively and to understand them as part of a larger context, while she trains her eye for detail and makes sure that he doesn't leave anything important out of his consideration. Both will attain insights which would have been out of their reach without the other. Probably he will bring her to confront the more basic aspects of life while expanding her horizons to include philosophical and religious questions. He knows he can rely on her when it comes to applying ideas in concrete situations, but also when it comes to managing every day life.
1801;SYNASTRIE_0000000000835906;His Jupiter in Trine with her Venus;Your need for harmony will be compatible with his way of seeing the world and both of you can give the other a lot, while leaving each other enough freedom to allow the relationship to last for a long time. He will animate you to think about the basic things in life and to look towards the future optimistically. In return, the affection he receives will make it easier for him to understand the true meaning of human nature and brotherly love. Most likely the two of you will be lucky enough to withstand life's challenges together.
1802;SYNASTRIE_0000000001098050;His Jupiter in Trine with her Mars;Both of you will find the relationship exciting, this will lead to many common activities. You will give each other enough space, having never intended to restrict the other in any way. The intellectual background you provide will animate your partner to question the purpose of her activities. You will expand her consciousness so that she can look for constructive things to do, which will also benefit you. Her courage and energy can be contagious, helping you to manage every day life and not get stuck in theory. All in all you will complement each other nicely.
1803;SYNASTRIE_0000000001360194;His Jupiter in Trine with her Jupiter;Probably you will have a happy relationship in which no one intends to worry unnecessarily or lose hope. Your convictions will usually be far apart, but each of you is open for the other's ideas and outlook. You won't chain each other up because each of you is independent and can get along on your own. Both of you recognize the value of an equal, balanced partnership
1804;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622338;His Jupiter in Trine with her Saturn;You will give your partner's drive to experience adventures form, which will provide the stable foundation he needs to unfold his ideas. Because your thinking is founded on realism, you will have to make sure that he always stays with the facts and that he puts his ideas into practice in a realistic manner. In this way you will keep your mind healthy and rational which will counteract his expansive character. Your relationship is characterized by a basic positive attitude, because you get along well. The mutual respect you have for each other will give your relationship a special flavor.
1805;SYNASTRIE_0000000001884482;His Jupiter in Trine with her Uranus;This aspect will bring a productive exchange between you on an intellectual level. Each of you is open to the other's ideas. Your free thinking character won't leave him unimpressed, and could even inspire him to new ideas. You don't restrict each other, because both of you are capable of thinking for yourselves. Therefore this will enrich both of you and you willingly confront each other. You don't necessarily have to melt into one, since you aren't opposed to keeping your individuality. Probably you have a lot of good ideas together.
1806;SYNASTRIE_0000000002146626;His Jupiter in Trine with her Neptune;You can show your partner how to make her dreams and visions into a philosophy of life and to use her imagination to pursue sensible goals. There probably won't be any problems with your communication, because you can converse without using a lot of words. You won't have any reservations about getting deeply involved with each other, and to adopt the other's ideas and principles when they seem reasonable. Your relationship may create a beautiful atmosphere characterized by mutual good will, shared dreams and sensitivity. A great love can evolve here.
1807;SYNASTRIE_0000000002408770;His Jupiter in Trine with her Pluto;This is a pleasant aspect which creates both depth and buoyancy in your relationship. Both of you can develop and learn from each other. You will be confronted with hope and intellectual freedom, while you will bring your partner to discover the returning cycles of life. He will be very impressed by your strength inspiring him to thoughts which may transform him. On the other hand, this relationship could help you to work through your disappointments as well as help you find your role within the community. When you exchange ideas, it will never be superficial, and each will take the other very seriously. Here a long lasting relationship can develop, because neither of you is afraid of losing the other.
1808;SYNASTRIE_0000000000065858;His Jupiter in Sextile with her Sun;"This aspect will enable you to recognize your partner's wishes, which will contribute substantially to the development of her personality. You will be able to support her when it comes to finding an appropriate expression of her individuality; and you will be presented with plenty of opportunity. Your actions toward her will be characterized by a deep sense of good will, although you will know from deep inside what is good for her and you will never force your advice on her.

The combination between her emotional world and his expanding tendencies should lead to an atmosphere allowing you to live together peacefully.
1810;SYNASTRIE_0000000000590146;His Jupiter in Sextile with her Mercury;This is a wonderful combination, because here the man's practical thinking harmonizes with the woman's view of the world. He can motivate her to see events with more objective distance and to recognize their position within a larger context, while she can train his eye for detail and make sure that he doesn't overlook important steps in his considerations. Both of you can achieve insights which wouldn't have been within reach without the partner. Probably he will lead her to confront the basic aspects of life, as well as expand her horizons by including philosophical and religious considerations. He knows that he can rely on her whenever it comes to applying ideas and incorporating them into concrete action and taking care of every day responsibilities.
1811;SYNASTRIE_0000000000852290;His Jupiter in Sextile with her Venus;Your need for harmony will be compatible with his way of seeing the world and both of you can give the other a lot, while leaving each other enough freedom to allow the relationship to last for a long time.

Your convictions will usually be far apart, but each of you is open for the other's ideas and outlook. You won't chain each other because both of you are independent and can get along on your own. You recognize the value of a partnership based on equality.
1814;SYNASTRIE_0000000001638722;His Jupiter in Sextile with her Saturn;You will give your partner's drive to experience adventures form which will provide the stable foundation he needs to unfold his ideas.

1817;SYNASTRIE_0000000002425154;His Jupiter in Sextile with her Pluto;This is a pleasant aspect which creates both depth and buoyancy in your relationship. Both partners can develop by learning from each other. You will be confronted with hope and intellectual freedom, while you will bring your partner to discover the returning cycles of life. He will be very impressed by your strength inspiring him to thoughts which may turn out to be transforming. On the other hand, this relationship could help you to work through your disappointments as well as help you find your role within the community. When you exchange ideas, it will never be superficial, and each will take the other very seriously. Here a long lasting relationship can develop, because neither of you is afraid of losing the other.
1818;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000386;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Sun;Your partner will be in a position to support your personal development. He may be older than you, so that it should really be possible for him to put his good will into practice. He will be instrumental in forming your character, but he should make sure that you consent to the development. Basically this aspect offers the potential to treat each other with mutual understanding, through which both of you can learn to see your life together as part of a greater context. This insight will lead you to transform the existing potential for conflict (which is a part of nearly every relationship) into creative activities for the two of you. This will enrich your lives and bring you closer to your goal of finding happiness together.
1819;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262530;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Moon;"Here it will come to a union challenging you to avoid restricting your partner emotionally. Both of you should become aware that your mutual claim of ownership on each other is extreme forcing you to look for an appropriate way to check this tendency. For your partner it will be important to devote herself to the independent development of her personality in order to show you that the relationship has to be an equal exchange. She shouldn't let herself be put down; you should reflect on how little use it will be to you to have a woman at your side who follows you unconditionally. Both of you will have to make it a priority goal if things are supposed to change. There is also the possibility that you will feel at home in an atmosphere in which one partner more or less ""belongs"" to the other."
1820;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524674;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Mercury;The man will have a great influence on his partner's thoughts, still he should make sure that he doesn't restrict her too much and stifle her imagination. He could teach her what it means to take on responsibility and to take care of organizing every day life. This will form his mind and helps him to develop maturity and the capacity to reflect. She wants his approval and will think a lot about his opinion. This aspect stands for a stable relationship in which no decisions are made under time pressure.
1821;SYNASTRIE_0000000000786818;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Venus;In her relationship mutual trust and security will play a great role. She won't hide her emotions and is interested in having a harmonious relationship. This is why he won't hesitate to get involved with her and will treat her right. He will bring stability into the relationship and can make rational decisions for both of them, without restricting her. In fact she is happy to be able to rely on him and appreciates the way he gives her the opportunity to express her tenderness. Being together with her is good for him because he needs the warmth and affection that she gives him.
1822;SYNASTRIE_0000000001048962;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Mars;"You have a good grip on your partner's activities and can coordinate them or direct them towards a sensible goal. Most likely you are more mature and more reasonable than your partner, which can only help the relationship. She will have the feeling that she can rely on you; she is also willing to take your advice. That will give her a secure footing providing her with the freedom she needs to play around, although it will also serve as foundation to build on. You two make a good team and if you are able to get caught up in your partner's enthusiasm and can manage to be flexible and spontaneous, a stable and active relationship could be the result."
1823;SYNASTRIE_0000000001311106;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Jupiter;Anytime your partner wants to overstep boundaries, you will prevent her, which is good. This relationship will have a drive for expansion and enthusiasm for life which includes being reasonable and taking obligations seriously. This combination will keep you in balance. You should try not to restrict her too much, because it could make her react defiantly. If you could accept some of her ideas wholeheartedly and without reservations, it would make her very happy. In turn she should know how to appreciate being able to rely on you and also listen to you on occasion. This relationship will have good chances, because it is light as well as serious.
1824;SYNASTRIE_0000000001573250;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Saturn;Both of you know what you want from a relationship and are willing to accept restrictions. Your values are about the same, which could make the relationship stable. You would like to build something together, and should be successful because each of you stands by the other, whenever things get tough. You will have the feeling that are able to rely on each other and both of you take the other seriously. Because you are about the same age (although one of you might be 30 years older than the other) you may have similar experiences which will help you to understand each other better.
1825;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835394;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Uranus;With this aspect an awareness of tradition and belief in progress will be combined harmoniously. You will be able to change your partner's outlook on life and make him more optimistic. In addition you will motivate him to throw his outdated behavior overboard and adopt a way of thinking which is more in tune with today. You probably enrich his formerly dismal and gray world. He will gain enthusiasm and will be willing to risk growing and developing himself. In turn, he can offer you stability. This is very important for somebody who changes as quickly as you do. He can also teach you to give your ideas form and structure, making you more realistic and reliable. This will allow you to complement each other nicely.
1826;SYNASTRIE_0000000002097538;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Neptune;Your partner, who usually stands with both feet on the ground, could find himself confused by your views and your behavior, although he will be basically fascinated by you and will do a lot to make sure that your ideas don't go unnoticed. Here two people have found each other, who can put a lot into the relationship and can intuitively recognize what is going on in the other. You will show him his inner wealth and make sure that he gains access to his dreams. He will be busy with his fantasies, which will make him softer and more emotional, while he will give her the opportunity to direct her efforts to a realistic goal. You should have a lot of wonderful experiences, making you more aware of how much you mean to each other.
1827;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359682;His Saturn in Conjunction with her Pluto;You can support your partner and help her to use her strengths constructively and to abide by the basic rules of society. She will become more reasonable through you, because she has finally found a safe harbor. She will learn to take stock of her energy and will try not to expand her consciousness with all kinds of excesses. If she has fought against herself, she will now appreciate the value of self-respect. In confrontations with her you will get to know your own strength, because you will successfully resist her while holding on to your system of values, even if you reevaluate them regularly.
1828;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016770;His Saturn in Opposition with her Sun;This aspect will make things complicated because a lot will depend on how the partner's relationship to her father has developed in the course of her life. If he determined how her life would be and still tries to be in control of her, it will be very difficult for her to avoid seeing her father in her partner. He may even reflect some of the restrictive elements of her childhood. He is going to have to relax, whereby she should support him. That could be the first step towards more self-confidence and personal integrity. Both of you should come to understand that you place restrictions on yourselves. Finding a creative way to transform this is Saturn's challenge with this aspect.
1829;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278914;His Saturn in Opposition with her Moon;This opposition will lend your partnership a bitter note. Both of you will be apt to fight battles which you have brought with you from your childhood. That can put both partners in danger of becoming unstable. Your partner will have the habit of ignoring your feelings and commanding you around. Maybe you don't feel that he understands you and his emotional frigidity may be frustrating. He also has high expectations and doesn't understand that you can't deal with that. If you could learn to rely on his affection, that would be tremendous progress. He should really make more of an effort to be more open to your needs.
1830;SYNASTRIE_0000000000541058;His Saturn in Opposition with her Mercury;"Maybe your partner is restricting your intellectual freedom and can't accept your ideas because he wants enough security to maintain the status quo. He would like to dominate and tries to influence you. He may feel responsible for everything, and doesn't give you a chance to become a responsible adult and make your own decisions. With enough good will it should be possible to find a way out of this mess; then the relationship could be stable."
1831;SYNASTRIE_0000000000803202;His Saturn in Opposition with her Venus;"Here your partner will do her best to make you feel guilty, just because you may not live up to his expectations of responsibility in this relationship. Sometimes you will feel that you are weaker than he is; in addition his determination and coolness put you off. On the other hand, he will often feel like he has to think and act for two. Before you can be really happy in this relationship, you are both going to have to experience each other in order to find out how much mutual devotion you have and what you are willing to sacrifice."
1832;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065346;His Saturn in Opposition with her Mars;Your partner will feel that her drive is being restricted and won't be willing to accept your advice. You are probably more mature and more reasonable, so that it would only make sense for her to listen to you. Sometimes she wishes that you were as enthusiastic as she is and could overcome your inhibitions about simply jumping up and doing something. Both of you have to realize that you would make a good team together. Your partner has the courage while you have the stamina and are serious enough to carry something out to its successful completion. Both of you should admit to your strengths and weaknesses, if you want the relationship to last. Most importantly your partner will need plenty of freedom to learn from her own mistakes and should appreciate being able to rely on you.
1833;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327490;His Saturn in Opposition with her Jupiter;"Probably the woman has restricted her partner somewhat, because he doesn't think as freely as she does. She needs a certain amount of independence, tolerance and honesty while he prefers to hang on to traditional values out of fear of change. Here two adverse philosophies will collide. He is willing to take on responsibility for a life together and to offer his partner security and constancy, but that isn't enough for her. Her world is simply larger than his; she is curious and wants new experiences, while he doesn't want to go along. She may be unwilling to commit himself and may be hurting him. You should recognize that you would make a great team if you could recognize each other's qualities."
1834;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589634;His Saturn in Opposition with her Saturn;There could be a lot of problems in your partnership, because each of you lives by different rules and shouldn't expect the same behavior from each other. It is as if each of you is headed in another direction. You are about 15 years older than your partner and may try to use the age difference to restrict the other. You will find that your partner won't accept that and has concrete ideas about life and therefore set goals for his life. If you want to stay together, you need to overcome some hurdles, first of all to respect that each of you has to make your decisions independently. That is the only way you are going to make it together.
1835;SYNASTRIE_0000000001851778;His Saturn in Opposition with her Uranus;Some of your most meaningful experiences will be together with your partner, even if they aren't always painless. At first you will try to make your partner understand your outlook on life and not try to assume ownership of her, although you won't get very far with that anyway. She will never give up her freedom and she looks for an interesting exchange in the partnership, but not a safe harbor. That won't leave you unimpressed, and once you have learned your lesson, you hopefully will start to seriously consider her ideas. She could motivate you to make some necessary adjustments in your life, although it will be difficult for you to throw your ingrained patterns of behavior overboard. She will recognize that continuity and stamina are useful qualities, which can help her get ahead. If you walk your path together, past and future will meet in your relationship.
1836;SYNASTRIE_0000000002113922;His Saturn in Opposition with her Neptune;Probably he feels that there is no chance of reaching her, even if you invest every ounce of your energy. It may be that it is difficult for him to think clearly in her presence, which is certainly due to her charm and the strong attraction. Unfortunately the two of you have very different ideas about your goals and values. He could try to take responsibility for her, but should avoid it to save himself from disappointments later on. Maybe he thinks she is lost in her dreams and is incapable of making her way in the real world. But that may be deceiving. He should approach her with sensitivity and tenderness, that will give the relationship a chance. She should recognize that his outlook on life is right for him and he will never be a knight in shining armor.
1837;SYNASTRIE_0000000002376066;His Saturn in Opposition with her Pluto;Here strong energies will collide, because each of you is convinced that you should carry out your principles. You could very well convey support and confidence to your partner, but that will only be successful if she is receptive to it. It probably bothers her that you are so established and fulfill every obligation. It may be too boring for her, she is out for extreme experiences and wants to move on, no matter what happens. She will ask a lot of questions which are unpleasant for you because they threaten to knock you off balance. You will find your relationship to be restless or even lively and you should watch out that you pull the emergency brake at the right moment, which will probably be up to you. You can learn from each other, but it won't be easy.
1838;SYNASTRIE_0000000000033154;His Saturn in Square with her Sun;This aspect will make things complicated because a lot will depend on how the partner's relationship to her father has developed in the course of her life. If he determined how her life would be and still tries to be in control of her, it will be very difficult for her to avoid seeing her father in her partner. He may even reflect some of the restrictive elements of her childhood. He is going to have to relax, whereby she should support him. That could be the first step towards more self-confidence and personal integrity. Both of you come to the realization that if you don't put some distance between you and your past, you will only be caging yourselves in. Finding a creative way to transform this situation is Saturn's challenge of this aspect.
1839;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295298;His Saturn in Square with her Moon;This is a challenging aspect making it difficult for both of you to express your feelings openly and honestly. Your partner will have little understanding for your inner world and will try to dominate you. You will suffer under his emotional frigidity, but won't be able to get away from him because he provides you with stability and security on a social level. Maybe he thinks that you are moody and too weak and has high expectations you can't fulfill. The external success is not as important to you as it is to him. Both of you may feel helpless because you want to clear things up. Take a look at the other aspects of this horoscope before you draw a final conclusion.
1840;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557442;His Saturn in Square with her Mercury;Most likely you feel being restricted by your partner because he can't accept your intellectual free will. He may subscribe to morals which you find outdated. His security is your oppression. Also he won't be receptive to your ideas because he primarily sees the risks and negative consequences of any endeavor. On the other hand, he will have a hard time understanding how you feel because some things which you are convinced of don't seem to have any rational basis from his perspective. It can be difficult to resolve this problem, but the only way to approach it is by talking openly with each other with a lot of sensitivity.
1841;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819586;His Saturn in Square with her Venus;This is a difficult aspect because your partner will have a tendency to dominate and to restrict you. He is willing to take on all the responsibility for you, but expects to be respected for it. Even though you know that you can rely on him and appreciate it, you are often dissatisfied with the situation. He will have a hard time letting you loosen him up, even though it would give him more self-confidence. This is why this relationship is lacking life and spontaneity. What you really want is honest affection, but what you end up getting is security. Your partner should be aware that you are no longer a child and are capable of taking on responsibility. Once this has been cleared up, the relationship will probably be happier.
1842;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081730;His Saturn in Square with her Mars;If you can manage to meet each other half way, you could learn a lot from each other. She will have a hard time following his advice, because she is convinced that it would be in effect a submission to his will. Although a little guidance wouldn't do her any harm, but would allow her to coordinate her strength and work for a sensible goal. Maybe he approaches her awkwardly when he wants to criticize her, only provoking her to perform stunts which won't impress him anyway. She is brave, but he has the maturity to make sensible decisions, so that both of you could be successful, if you would only accept each other.
1843;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343874;His Saturn in Square with her Jupiter;Maybe your partner defends liberal, progressive ideas in order to gain your approval. In the relationship her drive for expansion and your hold on tradition will collide and cause friction. If you would just listen to each other, you could learn a lot and complement one another. The problem is that neither of you wants to come down from your pedestal and hold your own truth for the only valid one. If the relationship is supposed to last, your partner must learn to accept your limits and to make an effort to take responsibility for her behavior, while it would do you good to let yourself enjoy the pleasant side of life and not always be so serious.
1844;SYNASTRIE_0000000001606018;His Saturn in Square with her Saturn;"Your paths haven't crossed accidentally. Here each of you will have principles, which are not compatible with those of your partner. The problem is that neither of you is willing to deviate from your standpoint and may even try to convince the other. This creates challenge of this aspect; learning to tolerate and respect your partner's contradictory opinions. Each of you will make new experiences and you will learn a lot about how you can manage to get completely involved in the relationship. This includes the ability to compromise. Just don't make the mistake of restricting your partner or blocking her development."
1845;SYNASTRIE_0000000001868162;His Saturn in Square with her Uranus;"In your relationship two contradictory attitudes will collide with each other and challenge you to find a consensus. If you intend to stay together you have 

to come to terms with your different values. She believes in the future and wants to initiate changes which will improve the situation. She needs a feeling of freedom and independence and is willing to neglect her friends for the sake of togetherness within the partnership. On the other hand, he is convinced of obligations, tradition and moral and may even make the mistake of restricting her. Old and new will meet, and your task will be to recognize that our society needs roots as well as progress. It would be wonderful if you could find each other at this point."
1846;SYNASTRIE_0000000002130306;His Saturn in Square with her Neptune;There could be a lot of misunderstandings because you run the risk of talking over each other's heads. It is as if each of you were speaking a different language. Your partner talks about structure, security and tradition while you tell of your dreams, emotions and fantasies. Probably you could use someone to give you a sense of reality and self-discipline. Although your partner can usually find the right tone and will approach you with sensitivity, it can put you off and leave you with the impression that he is emotionally cold and provincial. When you try to share your emotional world with him, it scares him into thinking he has to place his principles at risk. You should see this as a challenge which both of you have to meet together.
1847;SYNASTRIE_0000000002392450;His Saturn in Square with her Pluto;This square could create some disappointments in your partnership. He would like to know where he stands with her, but is unable to explain her passionate nature. She isn't in the market for security, but wants to experience all kinds of things, even if it causes her to suffer. Her fascination for destruction may shock him, because he wants to slowly build up a foundation for life and doesn't have any problem conforming to society. Maybe he seems boring, but is one step ahead of her, because he stands behind everything he does. He should never allow himself to force his principles on her. Maybe she can bring him to make the necessary changes in his life. Both partners will need a lot of strength, but can make things easier on themselves if they listen attentively to the other.
1848;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049538;His Saturn in Trine with her Sun;"Your partner will have the capacity to promote your personal development. He may be older than you, enabling him to put all of his good intentions into practice. He can form your character and will be interested in doing it, while you won't object to it. 

Basically, this relationship will offer the potential to treat each other with understanding, through which you both learn to see your existence together in a larger context. This insight will transform a certain portion of your potential for conflict (only very few relationships can avoid this) into shared creative activities. This may invigorate both of you and will bring you a step closer to reaching a state of happiness."
1849;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311682;His Saturn in Trine with her Moon;Here it will come to a union in which it will be easy for you to avoid restricting your partner emotionally. Even if you should claim  ownership of each other, it won't be difficult for you to find an appropriate way to check this tendency. It will be important to the woman to devote herself to the independent development of her personality, while the man makes sure the exchange in this relationship is based on equality. He will hardly be interested in oppressing her and ending up with a woman at his side who follows him unconditionally.
1850;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573826;His Saturn in Trine with her Mercury;He is reasonable enough and has the stamina to direct her ideas into channels which promise to be successful. She feels secure with him because he adds a feeling of stability to her life enabling her to work intellectually. Maybe she will encourage his world of quiet contemplation a little so that he can develop a more tolerant attitude in some areas. With this aspect the relationship will hardly reach hasty conclusions.
1851;SYNASTRIE_0000000000835970;His Saturn in Trine with her Venus;"You are very happy to have a partner you can rely on, when it comes to making rational decisions. He will have no problem getting involved with you and respecting your emotions, because the affection you give him will replenish his strength. With him at your side, you can be honest about your emotions and even let yourself be vulnerable. This will enrich his life with both joy and tranquility. You will be able to lead a stable and reliable relationship; unless other factors in your horoscopes tell a different story."
1852;SYNASTRIE_0000000001098114;His Saturn in Trine with her Mars;You have certain expectations on a partnership, and your partner will have no problems fulfilling them with her level of energy. She knows that she can rely on you and that you will make sure that the relationship is stable. Whenever she starts to worry about tomorrow, you create a calm atmosphere. You will influence her, but she will never let you reprimand or oppress her. The way you contemplate combined with your partner's drive to get out and do things will enable the two of you to build a firm foundation. She will initiate changes in your life, which will make you very happy and may let her open herself even more. You should make a good team.
1853;SYNASTRIE_0000000001360258;His Saturn in Trine with her Jupiter;You will give your partner's drive to experience adventures form, which will provide the stable foundation she needs to unfold her ideas. Because your thinking is founded on realism, you will have to make sure that she always stays with the facts and that she puts her ideas into practice in a realistic manner. In this way you will keep your mind healthy and rational which will counteract her expansive character. Your relationship is characterized by a basic positive attitude, because you get along well. The mutual respect you have for each other will give your relationship a special flavor.
1854;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622402;His Saturn in Trine with her Saturn;The two of you have similar ideas about relationships and don't intend to play with your partner's feelings. You can put your relationship on a stable foundation, by looking for a common goal, because you will be able to agree on questions of responsibility and obligations. Each of you will expect no more from the other than what you are able to give, which is the best pre-requisite for a long lasting relationship. You have respect for each other and will hopefully want to maintain it.
1855;SYNASTRIE_0000000001884546;His Saturn in Trine with her Uranus;You can be a great help to your partner when it comes to choosing a path for her life. Instead of trying to convince her of your own attitudes, you will respect and complement each other. You will appreciate her unique and imaginative nature. Especially when you start to take everything too serious. She will be like a refreshing breeze, who will relieve tension and bring about change. She will feel secure enough to rely on you and knows how important it is to stick together even when differences of opinion crop up. You will help her to see that life sometimes brings unpleasant obligations with it, which have to be fulfilled. Both of you may have problems with this.
1856;SYNASTRIE_0000000002146690;His Saturn in Trine with her Neptune;Whenever your partner is about to lose her grip on reality, you can bring her back down to Earth. You can also be very sensitive, so that waking up won't be painful for her. The two of you won't always have the same convictions, but will respect each other's differences, which will allow each of you to profit from your partner's strengths. You will appreciate the way she expresses her creativity and will do everything to support her. Also you will find her very attractive, which is one more reason to accept her as she is. She can learn from you that there are basic rules in society, everyone should follow, and to take responsibility for herself.
1857;SYNASTRIE_0000000002408834;His Saturn in Trine with her Pluto;This is a very beautiful aspect, which will bring stability and further development into the relationship. He is probably the quiet pole you can always return to whenever you are completely shaken up. She will be apt to make everything hard on herself and will want to experience things which won't always be in her best interest. Through him she will learn to budget her energy and to use it for constructive purposes. If she should ever be completely distraught, she can be sure that he will be there for her. In return, she will bring him to deep insights about his role in the universe. He will learn to keep up with the passing of time and not to be too compulsively tied to old structures. This will allow your partnership to grow.
1858;SYNASTRIE_0000000000065922;His Saturn in Sextile with her Sun;"Your partner will have the capacity to promote your personal development.

1868;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000450;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Sun;"Two things which are decisive for this aspect are your expectations of relationships and the flexibility of your partner. If you want to stay together you are going to have to learn to deal with unpredictable behavior. You will have to find out what kind of surprises your partner has in store for you. If your partner is constantly pulling things out of his sleeve which add loving touches to the relationship, or do you have to run to the bank to cover the bad checks he has written? It doesn't have to get quite so extreme, but this illustrates the range of experiences you may encounter. If something goes against your grain, you should try to get your way and not put up with anything. Try to greet this potential for surprises with humor as well as you can; your capacity for a sense of humor will be indicated by the other harmonious aspects manifesting themselves in this partnership horoscope. The two of you should set a common goal for yourselves which will direct your partner's energetic imagination in creative channels. That could be very important because otherwise the relationship may not be going anywhere, in spite of the tremendous amount of activity."
1869;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262594;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Moon;"Here your partner will always be good for surprises. You will feel this especially on an emotional level. Even if you usually enjoy it, you may be prone to feel insecure and then not know how to go about making that clear to your partner. Naturally this aspect will be dependent on the position of the planet Uranus in your partner's birth chart. If he is inclined to impulsive action, that will have an effect on the relationship. If he isn't prone to that kind of behavior, he will be capable of surprising you with a sincere expression of affection. Basically it will be noticeable that his aspect will bring a lot of changes into both of your lives; whether you can stand that, will be up to you."
1870;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524738;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Mercury;The man will have a stimulating effect on his partner's intellect. An intense exchange of ideas should develop which will be productive because new ideas are constantly being created. He doesn't have any limitations and is interested in everything new. That impresses her and animates her to the highest achievements. Maybe his impulsive behavior causes turmoil, but it is sure never to be boring. In this relationship both partners will have the opportunity to expand their intellectual horizons encompassing new ideas.
1871;SYNASTRIE_0000000000786882;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Venus;"Probably you fell in love quickly; and you may have felt the sparks intensely. Your partner appreciates your spontaneity and is probably not looking for a relationship to give her a feeling of security, because that may be lacking here. Still both of you can inspire each other and have a wonderful time together. Your partner won't have any problems showing her emotions openly, which will bring harmony into the relationship. She will be attracted to your unique and lively character, this reassurance will be good for you. It will hardly be boring, you should be happy to be together and remain optimistic."
1872;SYNASTRIE_0000000001049026;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Mars;A lot should happen in your relationship and rest assured it will never be boring. It may not be easy for your partner to get seriously involved with you, because dependency makes him nervous. But if you have enough energy to keep trying, he will eventually recognize that you have no intention of chaining him up with this relationship. your common activities will be new experiences for you. There will be more than just a romance between you, it will be true friendship and solidarity. Your partner's spontaneity will especially challenge you and allow you to discover your strength and courage.
1873;SYNASTRIE_0000000001311170;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Jupiter;Probably you have a lot of great ideas together, which will certainly include humor. This aspect will stimulate both of you intellectually. Both of you love a good discussion and like being together with people, so you probably have a large circle of friends. Probably you don't intend to put each other in chains, because you are both progressive and enlightened. He can teach her about freedom and tolerance in human interaction, while he will find out that the consciousness doesn't have to be restricted by boundaries. This is a wonderful aspect, and if you both keep your feet on the ground, your relationship will be rewarded with significant insights.
1874;SYNASTRIE_0000000001573314;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Saturn;In this aspect an awareness of tradition and belief in progress will be combined harmoniously. You will be able to change your partner's outlook on life and make her more optimistic. In addition you will motivate her to throw her outdated behavior overboard and adopt a way of thinking which is more in tune with today. You probably enrich her formerly dismal and gray world. She will gain enthusiasm and will be willing to risk growing and developing herself. In turn, she can offer you stability. This is very important for somebody who changes as quickly as you do. She can also teach you to give your ideas form and structure, making you more realistic and reliable. This will allow you to complement each other nicely.
1875;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835458;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Uranus;You should get along wonderfully because you both have high energy, active minds and a drive to research. Together you will have a lot of ideas, hopefully you will be able to realize some of them. You have a large circle of friends and should be open for new ideas. Probably you won't put each other in chains so that each of you will have enough freedom to further develop yourselves.
1876;SYNASTRIE_0000000002097602;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Neptune;Your partner's charm will have such an exciting effect on you that your mind is electrified by new ideas. This is a wonderful aspect which will lead to a productive exchange. Certainly it will promote the development of each of you while allowing your freedom. Your partner will give your imagination wings and will probably animate you to artistic creations. You will encourage him to combine his ideas with emotion, which may have been humanistic up until now, but were impersonal. You should understand each other well and be able to communicate without using a lot of words.
1877;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359746;His Uranus in Conjunction with her Pluto;A lot will happen in this partnership, because both of you want to encourage change and won't be satisfied with merely achieving your own security. You will have lively discussions and should have enough strength to realize your ideas. Your partner will lead you in constructive directions, which will give your life meaning. Through him you will discover that you can set positive goals and break with tradition if you have enough energy and will power. You probably have an unconventional lifestyle and don't worry about what the neighbors think. Your thoughts are on the future, and you will discover a social conscience.
1878;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016834;His Uranus in Opposition with her Sun;"With this aspect the flexibility of the partner will be very important, because if she is interested in continuing the relationship she is going to get used to the fact that her partner can be very unpredictable. She has to find out what kind of surprises he has in store for her. Does he add loving care to the relationship which he seems to pull out of his sleeve or is she always running to the bank to pay off the bad checks he has written? Things don't have to be so extreme, still this makes it clear how broad the spectrum of experiences can get. If something is going on which you can't accept, you are going to have to risk trying to get your way and not stand for any ill treatment. Opportunities to greet this potential for surprise with humor will be present to an extent determined by the effect of other harmonious aspects in this partnership horoscope. 

Perhaps you should set a common goal which will direct your partner's imaginative energies into creative channels, which may be very important due to the effects of stress and of your relationship's conflicts."
1879;SYNASTRIE_0000000000278978;His Uranus in Opposition with her Moon;She finds her partner too unpredictable and he can thoroughly confuse her. He has a hard time satisfying her need for emotional security, maybe he is simply too immature and lets himself get distracted easily. He may be bored with this relationship and can't understand why she wants to stay home rather than go out and meet people. Monotony will hardly be a problem with you, although you probably will neglect to satisfy each other's basic needs. The man has to learn responsibility, but also has to sustain her freedom in order to express his individuality.
1880;SYNASTRIE_0000000000541122;His Uranus in Opposition with her Mercury;Here the sparks probably fly often enough, stimulating your intellectual exchange. Sometimes you will be overwhelmed by your partner's unpredictable nature, because you would need a flexible and creative mind if you want to give this relationship even a minimum of stability. Often you simply can't follow what he is doing. On his part a lot of effort is required to make himself understandable. If you want to stay together, you have to get used to the fact that logic won't get you very far with him. In turn, he will inspire you and open new worlds to you. With a little consideration things may even be harmonious.
1881;SYNASTRIE_0000000000803266;His Uranus in Opposition with her Venus;With this opposition there will be a magnetic attraction between two people who probably have little in common. Your partner may have ideas about love, sex and romance which make you snicker, because they seem too conservative to you. The more your partner tries to get in touch with your unconventional personality, the more she will be aware of the differences between you. Because she may be fascinated by you, she could be torn between her desire to have you at her side and reality, which seems to indicate that she will never get what she wants.
1882;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065410;His Uranus in Opposition with her Mars;Your partnership will never be boring and may even be restless at times. You will try to win this man's affection and find a way to get through to his unapproachable nature, although his love of freedom may be stronger and win out in the end. Maybe he would rather be your good friend than your lover, which won't stop you from trying and investing every ounce of energy you have. If you can't let go and wait until he comes on his own, the end could be disappointing for both of you, but that might make you see how much you mean to him. You should take his ideas more seriously, that will make him happy.
1883;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327554;His Uranus in Opposition with her Jupiter;This opposition will create a lot of turmoil and dissatisfaction in the partnership. Maybe no one is willing to allow enough warmth and closeness to develop to give your relationship a foundation of trust. It will be hard for both of you to open yourself to the other and to sacrifice a bit of freedom. Maybe he has to criticize her constantly which causes her to back away. It would help you to discover what you have in common that you can build on. Conversations and even fights between you are sure to be lively, but you should try to reach a consensus.
1884;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589698;His Uranus in Opposition with her Saturn;Some of your most meaningful experiences will be together with your partner, even if they aren't always painless. At first you will try to make your partner understand your outlook on life and not try to assume ownership of him, although you won't get very far with that anyway. He will never give up his freedom and he looks for an interesting exchange in the partnership, but not a safe harbor. That won't leave you unimpressed, and once you have learned your lesson, you hopefully will start to seriously consider his ideas. He could motivate you to make some necessary adjustments in your life, although it will be difficult for you to throw you ingrained patterns of behavior overboard. He will recognize that continuity and stamina are useful qualities, which can help him get ahead. If you walk your path together, past and future will meet in your relationship.
1885;SYNASTRIE_0000000000033218;His Uranus in Square with her Sun;With this aspect the flexibility of the partner will be very important, because if she is interested in continuing the relationship she has to get used to the fact that her partner can be very unpredictable. She will have to find out what kind of surprises he has in store for her. He might add tender loving care to the relationship which he seems to pull out of his sleeve or she always runs to the bank to pay off the bad checks he has written? Things don't have to be so extreme, still this makes it clear how broad the spectrum of experiences can be. If something is going on which you can't accept, you are going to have to risk trying to get your way and not stand for any ill treatment. Opportunities to greet this potential for surprise with humor will be present to an extent determined by the effect of other harmonious aspects in this partnership horoscope. Perhaps you should set a common goal which will direct your partner's imaginative energies into creative channels. This may be very important due to the effects of stress and of your relationship's conflicts.
1886;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295362;His Uranus in Square with her Moon;This square will emphasize the woman's mothering instinct, which basically means that she is tormented by jealousy 24 hours a day  even if she isn't aware of it. His partner loves being independent and isn't willing to let himself be put on a chain. This will scare the woman because she thinks that she is losing control of the partnership. Also she is often hurt by her partner's unpredictable behavior. She doesn't feel secure with him, although she doesn't want to admit it. It may be that this relationship won't last very long, unless other aspects in this horoscope indicate otherwise.
1887;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557506;His Uranus in Square with her Mercury;Maybe the spark when you first met is what brought you together, but it is questionable whether this relationship can last. Maybe you are lacking understanding for your partner's unpredictable behavior and may demand more consistency than he can manage. You may have problems communicating due to stress and your hectic pace. Your partner may be apt to overwhelm you with all of his activities. He appreciates your creativity but you have trouble following his philosophy of life. You don't understand why anyone should think all the possibilities through before doing anything. This is a difficult aspect which will demand compromises from both sides.
1888;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819650;His Uranus in Square with her Venus;Probably you fell in love quickly, but it will be doubtful if the relationship will last. Your ideas about freedom and togetherness are simply too different. Maybe he can't appreciate the affection she gives, but feels trapped in the relationship. If he shows himself the way he really is, his lack of predictability could make her suffer because she needs more warmth and sensitivity. It won't be easy to resolve this conflict to everyone's satisfaction, although that is no reason not to try.
1889;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081794;His Uranus in Square with her Mars;Although her desire for him is almost overwhelming, she has a terrible time getting involved with him. He likes to pull away from her, which provokes her to extreme reactions but these do not impress him at all. His lack of predictability may even make her aggressive. The atmosphere between the two is probably always tense. She finds him impersonal and reserved, but the pressure she constantly exerts on him won't get her anywhere. She should be more relaxed and grant him enough freedom that he can willingly come to her some day.
1890;SYNASTRIE_0000000001343938;His Uranus in Square with her Jupiter;Maybe she allows herself to compare his actions with his words and to call attention to the discrepancies between them, although he can't bear it. He may accuse her of being too theoretical lacking pragmatic skills. In his view her ideas are so old-fashioned that they bear no relevance to the world of today. Here different outlooks on life will collide, and because neither of you likes to give in, you will have frequent arguments. Possibly she will find his approach impersonal, because he always runs off when she wants to have an important discussion. She is looking for a reasonable partnership, while for her, its not just him who counts, but also his many friends. It won't be easy to find a constructive solution to this dilemma.
1891;SYNASTRIE_0000000001606082;His Uranus in Square with her Saturn;In your relationship two contradictory attitudes will collide with each other and challenge you to find a consensus. If you intend to stay together you have to come to terms with your different values. He believes in the future and wants to initiate changes which will improve the situation. He needs a feeling of freedom and independence and is willing to neglect his friends for the sake of togetherness within the partnership. On the other hand, she is convinced of obligations, tradition and moral and may even make the mistake of restricting him. Old and new will meet, and your task will be to recognize that our society needs roots as well as progress. It would be wonderful if you could find each other at this point.
1892;SYNASTRIE_0000000001868226;His Uranus in Square with her Uranus;If this square shows up in a partnership horoscope, there is about a twenty year age difference. A generation conflict could result, which will make it hard for both of you to open yourselves to the other and to learn to trust. The relationship will be characterized by tension and a hectic pace, where neither of you will be able to contribute to tranquility and reflection. Each of you will insist on retaining your individuality, so that compromises are unimaginable. Maybe neither of you is willing to allow the other to get close. Probably you have heated discussions, but that won't bring about a tender relationship in which each of you can rely on the other. You are much to spontaneous to allow any predictions about the course of your partnership.
1893;SYNASTRIE_0000000002130370;His Uranus in Square with her Neptune;This relationship could use a portion of healthy reason. Both of you will have a hard time seeing yourself and the other in an objective light. You will find your partner's visions and dreams unrealistic, but will let yourself be confused by them. If you don't plan ahead, you could lose your orientation. You are often completely unpredictable, which may shock your partner because she is sensitive. There will be a lot of hurdles to overcome on your way to building a stable and reliable relationship, which may include misunderstandings.
1894;SYNASTRIE_0000000002392514;His Uranus in Square with her Pluto;Mutual trust is not necessarily a part of this relationship. You may try to make your partner understand your views by massively interfering in her life. She will fight against it with tooth and nail, which will only make you more determined to keep on. Both of you should try to avoid violent conflicts because they will only get you into trouble and keep you from living together in harmony. You will definitely need a common strategy for avoiding conflicts allowing you to identify points of conflicts as they develop and to eliminate them, the conflicts will always be over the same things, anyway.
1895;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049602;His Uranus in Trine with her Sun;With this aspect the partner will know that she will have to be flexible because she loves the unpredictability of her partner. She sees this potential for surprise as a way to renew her life even if it sometimes seems like she has completely lost control. She is willing to accept this because she intends to stay with him for a long time. If she has trouble accepting any of his behavior patterns, she should have the courage to do something about it. The harmonious nature of this aspect will allow for this and together you will enjoy the flood of surprises which will cross your paths. Both of you will make it your goal to direct your partner's imaginative energy into creative channels.
1896;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311746;His Uranus in Trine with her Moon;"Here your partner will always be good for surprises. You will feel this especially on an emotional level. Even if you usually enjoy it, you may be prone to feel insecure at times, but that won't be anything the two of you can't work out. Naturally this aspect will be dependent on the position of the planet Uranus in your partner's birth chart. If he is inclined to act impulsively, it will have an effect on the relationship. If he isn't prone to that kind of behavior, he will be capable of surprising you with expressions of affection. Basically it will be noticeable that his aspect will bring a lot of changes into both of your lives; whether you can stand that will be up to you."
1897;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573890;His Uranus in Trine with her Mercury;The man's individuality will be stimulating to her way of thinking.

She is simply open for your spontaneity; and may even be able to convince you to go along with her.

1899;SYNASTRIE_0000000001098178;His Uranus in Trine with her Mars;His lack of predictability will challenge you to put every ounce of your energy to the test.

You need to learn to live with the fact that he needs a lot of freedom.

She should enjoy getting a tour of his world and learning what it means to trust her intuition. On the other hand she can bring him back down to Earth whenever he gets caught up in his dreams and has a hard time coming to terms with the daily problems. Both will complement each other well; he can inspire her to emotional and inspirational ideas, while she will help him to structure his imagination and to develop a sense of reality."

You should treat each other tenderly with a lot of consideration; neither one of you has any reason to fear losing anything, and both of you give from your hearts. You can be very happy together, but should watch out that you keep your feet firmly on the ground."
1916;SYNASTRIE_0000000001049090;His Neptune in Conjunction with her Mars;This is an interesting conjunction, enabling you to keep your temper under control and to become more sensitive. Your partner in turn will profit from your energy and may be inspired to set some concrete goals for himself. If you can avoid treating him roughly and are considerate of his sensitivity, both of your lives will be enriched by the other.

She is open for him, because she recognizes the value of his visions. This synthesis of imagination and the search for truth will allow both of you to grow.
1918;SYNASTRIE_0000000001573378;His Neptune in Conjunction with her Saturn;Your partner, who usually stands with both feet on the ground, could find herself confused by your views and your behavior, although she will be basically fascinated by you and will do a lot to make sure that your ideas don't go unnoticed. Here two people have found each other, who can put a lot into the relationship and can intuitively recognize what is going on in the other.

She will be busy with her fantasies, making her softer and more emotional, while she will give him the opportunity to direct his efforts to a realistic goal. You should have a lot of wonderful experiences, making you more aware of how much you mean to each other.
1919;SYNASTRIE_0000000001835522;His Neptune in Conjunction with her Uranus;This aspect will occur in partnership horoscopes if both of you are about the same age. Because you belong to the same generation, you may have the same feelings and a similar outlook on life. It may be a very intense relationship, but there is a danger of being disappointed because Neptune can cloud your senses and your mind.
1920;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016898;His Neptune in Opposition with her Sun;Due to his intense sensitivity the male part will invest a lot of effort in supporting his partner's personal development. Although his suggestions may not always be met with complete agreement. Sometimes she will feel that he is preventing her from seeing thing clearly.

If he stands with both feet firmly on the ground, he will get both his partner and the relationship moving in a direction which you will both be happy with.
1921;SYNASTRIE_0000000000279042;His Neptune in Opposition with her Moon;He will be difficult for her to understand which will be complicated by the fact that problems in this relationship won't be laid open, but are more likely to be swept under the carpet. Both will allow emotional confusion to develop and will have trouble forming a realistic image of the other. You will sense an indefinite longing, but because it won't be expressed in words, the other won't be able to respond to it Maybe your ideals are too high and you aren't able to manage your day to day responsibilities. Don't try to reach for the stars, but create your own little paradise on Earth, otherwise this relationship will have an unpleasant ending.
1922;SYNASTRIE_0000000000541186;His Neptune in Opposition with her Mercury;Probably in this partnership it is the woman who makes the decisions and tries to be realistic. Her partner can give her a hard time in this respect, because he may undermine her logic with his dreams. She will find him very attractive and interesting, because she will experience a lot of new things with him, although he will always remain a mystery for her. The contrast between both may simply be too large to maintain a relationship over a longer period of time.
1923;SYNASTRIE_0000000000803330;His Neptune in Opposition with her Venus;With this opposition you may be amazed to discover that you have been living an illusion. You may think that your partner understands what you mean by the words love, sex and romance, but some day your are going to find out that it isn't the case and he has been misleading you, which is all the more tragic because he has been believing it herself. Although you are attracted by his imagination and gentleness, in the end it will only confuse you. If these misunderstandings aren't cleared up, you will have trouble leading an honest and happy relationship.
1924;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065474;His Neptune in Opposition with her Mars;She will invest all her energy in the relationship and will definitely want to get closer to him, although he may still like to pull away from her, because he isn't sure what he actually wants. There could be a lot of confusion, in which one might deceive the other, without even being aware of it. She is fascinated by his imagination and will have to come to realize that this is what is causing a lot of the problems. Maybe he finds her unrefined and is even afraid of her. If both of you would get closer to each other, she could come up with the necessary sensitivity, while he may find out how to realize his dreams.
1925;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327618;His Neptune in Opposition with her Jupiter;The woman will try to do everything he can to understand her partner, because he fascinates her and holds a strong attraction for her. Still she probably won't get behind the mystery of his thoughts because his mind functions in a completely different way. His reality doesn't have a lot in common with hers, and he places a lot of value on his dreams and visions. She tries to sort his emotional experiences into pigeon holes, but won't be very successful. Sometimes she has the feeling that he has gotten her confused, to the point where she can't keep up her outlook on life, still that will happen much too often for it to be productive or exciting. He should take a serious look at her system of values, while she should learn to respect his way of thinking and feeling. This will give the relationship a chance.
1926;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589762;His Neptune in Opposition with her Saturn;Probably she feels that there is no chance of reaching him, even if you invest every ounce of your energy. It may be that it is difficult for her to think clearly in his presence, which is certainly due to his charm and the strong attraction. Unfortunately the two of you have very different ideas about your goals and values. She could try to take responsibility for him, but may want to avoid it to save herself from disappointments later on. Maybe she thinks he is lost in his dreams and is incapable of making his way in the real world. But that may be deceiving. She should approach him with sensitivity and tenderness, that will give the relationship a chance. He should recognize that her outlook on life is right for her and she will never be a fairy princess.
1927;SYNASTRIE_0000000000033282;His Neptune in Square with her Sun;He will invest a lot of effort in supporting his partner's personal development, this is because he can be very sensitive. Although his suggestions may not always be met with complete agreement. Sometimes she will feel that he is preventing her from seeing things clearly. Neptune's position in his birth chart will determine the intensity of it's concealing influence. If he is generally prone to being carried away by his imagination, it will weigh heavily on the relationship. If he stands with both feet firmly on the ground, he will get both his partner and the relationship moving in a direction which you will both be happy with.
1928;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295426;His Neptune in Square with her Moon;This square won't make it easy for you to see reality as it unfolds. You confront problems emotionally and you will seldom find constructive solutions. When you argue you often step over boundaries, which should be respected. You have the feeling that your partner is hiding something from you, even if you aren't sure what it is. Your partner will completely confuse you emotionally, and may not even notice it. It may be that you don't see each other realistically. If you want to improve the situation, you should approach it rationally and be prepared to accept the truth, even if it is unpleasant.
1929;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557570;His Neptune in Square with her Mercury;Probably you feel that your partner is too rational and suffer because you can't share romantic dreams with her. She doesn't stand a chance of understanding your visions and your imagination, preferring to trust in reason, she feels at home in reality. This will lead to conflicts which will end in disappointments. If both of you want to continue this relationship, you have to be more open to his inner world and judge life's situations by more than just facts and figures, while your partner has to make more of an effort to follow your train of thought and live in the present.
1930;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819714;His Neptune in Square with her Venus;She will have a hard time understanding you, and in spite of all of her love and affection, she will never feel that she understands you and that you are someone she can rely on. Maybe you need her attention because you are unable to cope with life on your own. Also, you can confuse her so much that she won't know what she feels and will wonder why she ever wanted a relationship with you in the first place. Even if she finds you very attractive, she won't be able to get involved with you and share your dreams. You will feel insecure and won't believe that she loves you, and end up distorting everything in your mind until you aren't sure of anything anymore. You should talk about what is bothering you and think things through rationally, if nothing else helps.
1931;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081858;His Neptune in Square with her Mars;Maybe he will confuse her so much that she will wear herself out trying to understand him and to impress him, which doesn't even promise to be very successful. She could waste her energy trying to find out his secrets, because he really holds an attraction for her and arouses her imagination. He doesn't know how to deal with her energy and courage and finds her rough and unmannered. He also can't accept the way she thinks because she wants to be the boss and might decide to draw him out of his dream world. If this relationship is supposed to last, he needs to learn to trust her sense of reality while she will have to respect his sensitivity.
1932;SYNASTRIE_0000000001344002;His Neptune in Square with her Jupiter;If she doesn't make more of an effort to be open with her partner and show tolerance, there could be problems. She could tend to see all his diverse ideas and fantasies as part of a system, which restricts his creativity. It could cause confusion, where no one will know why the relationship got started in the first place and where it should be heading. Maybe she is self-righteous and isn't willing to take his individuality seriously. He feels restricted, but doesn't know what he should do, because he usually tries to avoid open conflicts. The survival chances of this relationship will depend on both partner's willingness to compromise.
1933;SYNASTRIE_0000000001606146;His Neptune in Square with her Saturn;There could be a lot of misunderstandings because you run the risk of talking over each other's heads. It is as if each of you were speaking a different language. Your partner talks about structure, security and tradition while you tell of your dreams, emotions and fantasies. Probably you could use someone to give you a sense of reality and self-discipline. Although your partner can usually find the right tone and will approach you with sensitivity, it can put you off and leave you with the impression that she is emotionally cold and provincial. When you try to share your emotional world with her, it scares her into thinking she has to place her principles at risk. You should see this as a challenge which both of you have to meet together.
1934;SYNASTRIE_0000000001868290;His Neptune in Square with her Uranus;This relationship could use a portion of healthy reason. Both of you will have a hard time seeing yourself and the other in an objective light. You will find your partner's visions and dreams unrealistic, but will let yourself be confused by them. If you don't plan ahead, you could lose your orientation. You are often completely unpredictable, which may shock your partner because he is sensitive. There will be a lot of hurdles to overcome on your way to building a stable and reliable relationship, which may include misunderstandings.
1935;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049666;His Neptune in Trine with her Sun;Your sensitivity will enable you to make use of your imagination when you take care of your partner and support her personal development. Especially when she is concerned, you will never have trouble coming up with new ideas which she will find flattering. Although it will hardly matter that you sometimes confuse her. Even if you are generally in danger of getting carried away with your imagination, your partner will support you in your efforts to keep both of your feet planted firmly on the Earth, thanks to the harmonious nature of this aspect. This will also enable you to show your gratitude for the creative impulses your partner adds to the relationship.
1936;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311810;His Neptune in Trine with her Moon;This aspect will produce a kind of mystic atmosphere in which both of you will feel attracted to each other. Each of you will perceive the needs and desires of the other with a great deal of sensitivity. The deep interests you share will provide the partnership with creative impulses, because Neptune and the Moon will unite two principles that will bring the two of you to recognize the significance of this within a greater context. If the rest of this partnership horoscope doesn't show extremely disharmonious characteristics, the relationship will last a long time.
1937;SYNASTRIE_0000000000573954;His Neptune in Trine with her Mercury;The woman's logic will converge harmoniously with the man's imagination. Through him she will probably come up with a lot of new ideas, because she will finally take the risk of deviating from the prescribed course now and then and will also place more trust in her intuition. She will also bring him to confront the trials and troubles of every day life, which will give him the opportunity to learn a lot of new things and may lead him to see the world more realistically. This aspect can be advantageous for both of you: he will train his logic and intellectual abilities while she will become mentally more open and judge situations on criteria other than numbers and facts.
1938;SYNASTRIE_0000000000836098;His Neptune in Trine with her Venus;"Your relationship should be very tender and will probably be open to other people's needs. You won't have any problems dreaming together and following your imagination wherever it leads you, because the energy flow between you will be as gentle as it is beautiful. You can create together and explore your artistic talents. Your strong sense of romance will bring you to spend a lot of wonderful hours together. Your partner's love will inspire you to share your visions with her; while she will let herself be guided through worlds which you have introduced her to. Intuitively both of you will sense the other's wishes, so that harmony will reign."
1939;SYNASTRIE_0000000001098242;His Neptune in Trine with her Mars;This Sextile will combine the woman's drive with the man's imagination.

Through him, she will become more sensitive while he will gain strength. Whenever he is down, she can bring him back to life and restore his courage, helping her out as much as him, because it brings her into contact with new ideas.
1940;SYNASTRIE_0000000001360386;His Neptune in Trine with her Jupiter;You can show your partner how to make his dreams and visions into a philosophy of life and to use his imagination to pursue sensible goals. There probably won't be any problems with your communication, because you can converse without using a lot of words. You won't have any reservations about getting deeply involved with each other, and to adopt the other's ideas and principles when they seem reasonable. Your relationship may create a beautiful atmosphere characterized by mutual good will, shared dreams and sensitivity. A great love can evolve here.
1941;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622530;His Neptune in Trine with her Saturn;Whenever your partner is about to lose his grip on reality, you can bring him back down to Earth. You can also be very sensitive, so that waking up won't be painful for him. The two of you won't always have the same convictions, but will respect each other's differences, which will allow each of you to profit from your partner's strengths. You will appreciate the way he expresses his creativity and will do everything to support him. Also you will find him very attractive, which is one more reason to accept him as he is. He can learn from you that there are basic rules in society, everyone should follow, and to take responsibility for himself.
1942;SYNASTRIE_0000000001884674;His Neptune in Trine with her Uranus;Even if your partner sometimes seems completely wound up, he can be taken with sudden impulses which he can express artistically. He will make sure that there is creativity, imagination and emotions in the relationship while you will take care of the spontaneity and unique ideas. Each of you likes to learn from the other, so that this relationship will be an enrichment for both of you. You can communicate on an intellectual level as well as just dream. That offers a lot of change in the relationship. You should look for a common project into which you can channel your wealth of ideas.

1950;SYNASTRIE_0000000001901058;His Neptune in Sextile with her Uranus;Even if your partner sometimes seems completely wound up, he can be taken with sudden impulses which he can express artistically. He will make sure that there is creativity, imagination and emotion in the relationship while you will take care of the spontaneity and unique ideas. Each of you likes to learn from the other, so that this relationship will be an enrichment for both of you. You can communicate on an intellectual level as well as just dream, initiating a lot of change in the relationship. You should look for a common project to channel your wealth of ideas into.
1951;SYNASTRIE_0000000000000578;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Sun;With this aspect two people who can learn a lot from each other will be together, that is if you manage to stay together. A lot of things will run on instinct and will lead you into situations which will transform you. One partner may behave in a way which can only be described as extremely passionate. Together you will experience a broad emotional spectrum and if it works out, you will be able to go through your experiences in a positive way and make the relationship last a long time. Still if neither of you is in a position to overcome your nature, it will be difficult to work things out between you. Additionally you should consider other aspects of the partnership horoscope before making a definitive judgement about yourselves based solely on this aspect.
1952;SYNASTRIE_0000000000262722;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Moon;"Here the relationship will be dependent to a great extent on the balance each of you maintains outside the partnership. You should be prepared to put your partner's emotional world to the test, because you see exactly what has to be changed in her life. There is nothing wrong with confrontation, but you are going to have to watch out that the intensity doesn't scare her off. If you are able to find a golden means, the dynamic energies growing out of it should provide the foundation for building a relationship on which you can live more or less ""worry free""."
1953;SYNASTRIE_0000000000524866;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Mercury;He will probably initiate a lot of changes in her thoughts. The relationship will force her to think about things which interest him, yet being completely new to her. Maybe he will confuse her so thoroughly, that she will have to develop a completely new way of thinking. This will initiate a novel chance for intellectual growth. It may also motivate changes with respect to sex and lead him to a free and more tolerant way of approaching this subject. Probably he will have a stronger will than she does, which can only help the relationship.
1954;SYNASTRIE_0000000000787010;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Venus;Your partner will change you and you won't struggle against it because it feels right. There is a great sexual attraction between you, setting a lot in motion. Through you your partner will learn to direct his strength and his will toward positive ambitions and to allow love and harmony to develop. You will take away some of his bitterness, in turn he will be a living example of how you can get your way in life. Together you can achieve a lot and eventually withstand crises unharmed, because you have learned that there are limits on how far you can go, even in a fight.
1955;SYNASTRIE_0000000001049154;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Mars;Together you will have an unbelievable amount of energy you shouldn't waste. If you both make sure to be careful and not overdo it you could be very successful. You can live out your passions in bed. Maybe you can get your partner out of her shell and help her to recognize her strength and courage. She can help you to work through your disappointments which will make you very happy. Your relationship will be temperamental, still you should try not to overstep certain boundaries.
1956;SYNASTRIE_0000000001311298;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Jupiter;Here you will sometimes be able to cheer up your partner when he is depressed, and maybe even give him the courage to face life again. He will let herself fall deeply into his consciousness, but through you the way to get there won't be as dark and will have more meaning. Together you can regenerate all of his strength again. Thinking about your motivation will bring him to see the world in another way which will make him more optimistic. You will get to know your strengths and will add depth to your thoughts. Through him you will be able to internalize the returning cycles of life.
1957;SYNASTRIE_0000000001573442;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Saturn;You can support your partner and help him to use his strengths constructively and to abide by the basic rules of society. He will become more reasonable through you, because he will have finally found a safe harbor. He will learn to take stock of his energy and will try not to expand his consciousness with all kinds of excesses. If he has fought against himself, he will now appreciate the value of self-respect. In confrontations with him you will get to know your own strength, because you will successfully resist him while holding on to your system of values, even if you reevaluate them regularly.
1958;SYNASTRIE_0000000002359874;His Pluto in Conjunction with her Pluto;Pluto moves very slowly when it is being observed from the Earth, so this is a generation aspect, which will occur in a lot of partnership horoscopes these days. You both watched the same developments in society and probably have at least some of the same needs. It will be necessary to consult the other aspects in order to make concrete statements about this relationship.
1959;SYNASTRIE_0000000000016962;His Sun in Opposition with her Pluto;With this aspect, two people have come together who can learn a lot from each other, if they manage to stay together. The most intense conflicts will occur in the context of instinctive behavior and will get you into situations where a need to transform yourselves will arise. The time you spend together may be characterized as extremely passionate. Both of you find it important to work out the relationship constructively, otherwise you may be at risk tearing each other apart. If neither of you is in a position to overcome your fear of change, it may be difficult to keep this relationship going. Here you should take all the aspects of the partnership horoscope into consideration before forming an opinion on one aspect of the chart.
1960;SYNASTRIE_0000000000279106;His Pluto in Opposition with her Moon;"This partnership is guaranteed to never get boring, but also will seldom be harmonious. Maybe you are looking for the kind of security which your partner has to offer, but are incapable of accepting it out of fear of becoming dependent. You will bring excitement into this relationship, which your partner won't always find pleasant. Maybe she is a little overwhelmed and can't stand up to your will power. You will have trouble dealing with her emotions and making yourself more sensitive to her feelings. Because you are quickly dissatisfied with the situation, you will need constant change; this in turn will come into conflict with your partner's need for security. This aspect will be a challenge that could teach you a lot."
1961;SYNASTRIE_0000000000541250;His Pluto in Opposition with her Mercury;It may be difficult for you to get along. With your partner's will power and energy, he may try to influence your thinking as well as manipulate your decisions, which you will fight with every ounce of reason. Power struggles may be part of your daily agenda and thoroughly screw up your life, because your discussions are seldom productive. You are faced with a challenge offering you an opportunity to grow. If the attraction between you wouldn't be so great, you would have nothing to do with each other.
1962;SYNASTRIE_0000000000803394;His Venus in Opposition with her Pluto;This aspect will demonstrate temperament and a lack of predictability to the extent, that it shouldn't be surprising if the relationship doesn't last very long. She will be put off by his displays of aggression, which may be expressed in a sexualized manner. Also her ideas about love and romance don't jive with his, so that she will often withdraw in disappointment. Everywhere where Pluto is involved, there will be regeneration and transformation and if this aspect is challenging, you can use the friction it provides, to grow together.
1963;SYNASTRIE_0000000001065538;His Pluto in Opposition with her Mars;Probably things are pretty explosive around you, because both of you will have a hard time accepting the other person's will. Maybe you fight a lot, even to the extent where physical violence breaks out. It wouldn't be surprising if you end up in bed afterwards. Both of you should learn to keep your ego under control in order to give this relationship a chance. He would like to change this, but she is fighting it tooth and nail. He has a special talent for seeing through her motives, which only serves to make her more aggressive. Pull the emergency brake before one of you gets hurt so badly that it can't be healed.
1964;SYNASTRIE_0000000001327682;His Pluto in Opposition with her Jupiter;In your partnership there will probably be a lot of fighting or undercurrents of resentment. Two contradictory attitudes on life will battle against each other. While the world is bright and interesting for her, he sees more dark tones. He is very strong and has a will power which is so amazing that it scares her. She is looking for lightness and wants to live her life according to humanistic ideals, while he is fighting with himself and may consider her superficial. Happiness and pain will come together here, but it will be difficult for both of you to recognize that one will bring the other with it. If he continues to try to change her or even to control her, he is going to lose her.
1965;SYNASTRIE_0000000001589826;His Pluto in Opposition with her Saturn;Here strong energies will collide, because each of you is convinced that you should carry out your principles. You could very well convey support and confidence to your partner, but that will only be successful if he is receptive to it. It probably bothers him that you are so established and fulfill every obligation. It may be too boring for him, he is out for extreme experiences and wants to move on, no matter what happens. He will ask a lot of questions which are unpleasant for you because they threaten to knock you off balance. You will find your relationship to be restless or even lively and you should watch out that you pull the emergency brake at the right moment, which will probably be up to you. You can learn from each other, but it won't be easy.
1966;SYNASTRIE_0000000000033346;His Pluto in Square with her Sun;With this aspect, two people are brought together who can learn a lot from each other, that is if you manage to stay together. The most intense conflicts will occur in the context of instinctive behavior and will get you into situations where you have to transform yourselves. The time you spend together may be characterized as extremely passionate. Both of you will have to find it important to work out the relationship constructively, otherwise you may will run the risk of tearing each other apart. If neither of you is in a position to overcome fear of change, it may be difficult to keep this relationship going. Here you should take all the aspects of the partnership horoscope into consideration before forming an opinion on one aspect of it.
1967;SYNASTRIE_0000000000295490;His Pluto in Square with her Moon;You were looking for a strong partner, who you could hardly control and who doesn't require a lot of support. He would prefer you to take more risks and not look for comfort in the middle of the family. While he wants to experience things which you are afraid of, you prefer to stay at home with him and make yourselves comfortable. He loves to overturn convention and live out his strengths. It may be that power struggles are going on below the surface, which aren't helping either of you. You should come to terms with the fact that you won't find the emotional security you need with this man.
1968;SYNASTRIE_0000000000557634;His Pluto in Square with her Mercury;"Probably when the two of you fight all hell breaks loose; one can only hope that you don't go beyond tolerable limits. Your partner is going to be a constant challenge to your intellect and his will power will make yours seem weak in comparison. You will look for rational solutions to problems while he is only concerned about instigating change at any price. Your efforts to understand him could lead you into dangerous areas, the best you can hope for is to be amazed at what you may discover. Although you remain fascinated by him, you are definitely in over your head. You may have a passionate relationship, but whether it will last is another question."
1969;SYNASTRIE_0000000000819778;His Pluto in Square with her Venus;This relationship can quickly turn into a dependency leading to frustration. What she considers love and togetherness, is a suppression of natural instincts for him. He want to have his own way no matter what, and may even look for other women if he has the feeling that he might be missing out on something. Probably the woman has the weaker role in this relationship because she is more vulnerable than he is. He isn't just looking for harmony with her, but wants to experience all sorts of things. This relationship could be a tremendous challenge for both of you, but there is still a chance for personal growth if you can handle the crisis.
1970;SYNASTRIE_0000000001081922;His Pluto in Square with her Mars;Both of you are afraid of missing something if you should decide to get involved with the other and commit yourself. He can see right through her motives and finds her too primitive at times, because he has his own ambitions, which he pursues with all his power. Both egos are very strong and unwilling to compromise. Maybe sex is the only thing you can agree on, but that is no basis for a long-term harmonious relationship. She may want to conquer him, but he isn't the right kind of man. Senseless power struggles could make up a part of your daily agenda. If this relationship is supposed to last, you should learn to compromise.
1971;SYNASTRIE_0000000001344066;His Pluto in Square with her Jupiter;Probably you are a lot less complicated than your partner and don't understand why anyone should torment themselves searching for insights the way he does. You would love to simply have fun together, but he is too caught up with his own thoughts and too concerned with the past to relax and enjoy himself. Maybe he considers you to be superficial and foolish because he hasn't yet experienced that people often don't recognize the truth until they have given up searching. He is convinced that every development has to be fought for, but he feels you aren't interested enough. Misunderstandings and conflicts could be the result.
1972;SYNASTRIE_0000000001606210;His Pluto in Square with her Saturn;This square could create some disappointments in your partnership. She would like to know where she stands with him, but is unable to explain his passionate nature. He isn't in the market for security, but wants to experience all kinds of things, even if it causes him to suffer. His fascination for destruction may shock her, because she wants to slowly build up a foundation for life and doesn't have any problem conforming to society. Maybe he finds her boring, but she is one step ahead of him, because she stands behind everything she does. She should never allow herself to force her principles on him. Maybe he can bring her to make the necessary changes in her life. Both partners will need a lot of strength, but can make things easier on themselves if they listen attentively to the other.
1973;SYNASTRIE_0000000001868354;His Pluto in Square with her Uranus;Mutual trust is not necessarily a part of this relationship. You may try to make your partner understand your views by massively interfering in his life. He will fight against it with tooth and nail, which will only make you more determined to keep on. Both of you should try to avoid violent conflicts because they will only get you into trouble and keep you from living together in harmony. You will definitely need a common strategy for avoiding conflicts allowing you to identify points of conflicts as they develop and to eliminate them, the conflicts will always be over the same things, anyway.
1974;SYNASTRIE_0000000000049730;His Pluto in Trine with her Sun;"This aspect concerns two people who have found each other, in order to learn from each other. A lot will take place instinctively and will lead both to a harmonious transformation. This relationship will be characterized by passion. Together you will experience a broad spectrum of emotions; your ability to work through them constructively will enable you to stay together for a long time. Both of you will be in a position to overcome your inhibitions and accept changes.

If this aspect is productive, you should take the rest of the partnership horoscope into consideration before forming your opinion about the whole relationship."
1975;SYNASTRIE_0000000000311874;His Pluto in Trine with her Moon;"Here the relationship will be to a great extent dependent on the balance each of you maintains outside the partnership. You should be prepared to put your partner's emotional world to the test, because you see exactly what has to be changed in her life. There is nothing wrong with confrontation, but you are going to have to watch out that the intensity doesn't scare her off. If you are able to find a golden means, the dynamic energies which will grow out of it should provide the foundation for building a relationship on which you can live more or less ""worry free""."
1976;SYNASTRIE_0000000000574018;His Pluto in Trine with her Mercury;Probably your discussions aren't superficial, but you support each other in getting to the bottom of things. Maybe he can change the way she thinks and can help her to reach deep insights. Through her he will learn how to take care of little things in every day life and to give his activities direction. She feels attracted to him, because his strength and will power are so compelling that she can get caught up in it. Even if he dominates the relationship, he will still be able to give his partner a lot.
1977;SYNASTRIE_0000000000836162;His Pluto in Trine with her Venus;She will use her strength and will power to bring about changes in both of you. Maybe with your help she can overcome disappointments which have been bothering her. Your affection and trust will make her become more gentle and that will allow her to experience more joy in life. On the other hand you will get to know your strengths and will realize that you have access to a hidden energy source, which you can activate at anytime. Both of you will experience that love will conquer every inner crisis and that light only exists because there is darkness.
1978;SYNASTRIE_0000000001098306;His Pluto in Trine with her Mars;"He will change her and bring out energy reserves, she didn't know she had to her disposal, because he will be constantly challenging her. She will enable him to experience more joy in life and let him take on concrete goals. There is such a strong attraction between you that the relationship will probably center around passionate sex. He will bring her to ask questions he never asked before; possibly she will experience things provoking her to revise the way she sees the world. She will show him how to live in the here and now as well as how to free himself of disappointments from the past."
1979;SYNASTRIE_0000000001360450;His Pluto in Trine with her Jupiter;This is a pleasant aspect which creates both depth and buoyancy in your relationship. Both of you can develop and learn from each other. You will be confronted with hope and intellectual freedom, while you will bring your partner to discover the returning cycles of life. She will be very impressed by your strength inspiring her to thoughts which may transform her. On the other hand, this relationship could help you to work through your disappointments as well as help you find your role within the community. When you exchange ideas, it will never be superficial, and each will take the other very seriously. Here a long lasting relationship can develop, because neither of you is afraid of losing the other.
1980;SYNASTRIE_0000000001622594;His Pluto in Trine with her Saturn;This is a very beautiful aspect, which will bring stability and further development into the relationship. She is probably the quiet pole you can always return to whenever you are completely shaken up. He will be apt to make everything hard on himself and will want to experience things which won't always be in his best interests. Through her he will learn to budget his energy and to use it for constructive purposes. If he should ever be completely distraught, he can be sure that she will be there for him. In return, he will bring her to deep insights about her role in the universe. She will learn to keep up with the passing of time and not to be too compulsively tied to old structures. This will allow your partnership to grow.

1988;SYNASTRIE_0000000000003268;Prolog;"Welcome to the partner comparison. This makes it possible to see the energies which have influence on your relationship more closely and to find out if you have common goals, interests and temperaments.



What is synastry?



In the form of partner comparison presented here, the so-called synastry, two charts will be compared with each other by looking at which aspects the planets of the two partners form, such as his Moon and her Sun. 



A short interpretation for each of these aspects will be included, whereby it will be your task to bring them to a comprehensible unit, which won't be easy. But you probably know how difficult and contradictory the patterns of behavior in a relationship can be.



To summarize it should be said here that the synastry can sometimes be useful, but decisions about whether to initiate or end a relationship shouldn't be based on the comparison of horoscopes. A relationship with problems doesn't necessarily have to be ""bad"", just as a relationship without problems isn't necessarily ""good"". This is why this interpretation can help to recognize latent potential as well as possible hindrances."
1989;TRANSIT_0000000000147718;Transiting Mars in your tenth house;This is at least a two month long period during which you should openly assert your position and eventually redefine it. In this period you will have all the power you need to deal with it responsibly. This is so important that Saturn, who is linked to the tenth house, will bring drastic measures if you arent careful. Allow yourself to be strong willed, you are entitled to it, but make sure that you dont offend the people around you. As long as you keep that in mind you will be able to use your energy to improve your professional position as well as for political activity in case you are inclined, which will bring you more satisfaction in life. It would be ideal if your energy served to improve the situation of others at the same time.
1990;TRANSIT_0000000000131334;Transiting Mars in your ninth house;This would be a good time to let your pioneer spirit run free. Currently you have a lot of energy to devote to intellectual expansion. Take advantage of every opportunity to expand your horizons and take long trips to far off places. You could also assert yourself in foreign countries and confidently come into contact with the people living there. Just dont approach new fields of interest with too much fanaticism and make sure that you keep some distance because objectivity and well balanced judgments arent exactly your strong point. If you want to convince others of your ethics or beliefs, you are going to have to open yourself up to their perspective or your credibility will suffer. Enroll in a Shiatsu course which you have been interested in for a long time and if you value Astrology start studying it on your own. Astrology has the advantage that you can learn it without complicated examinations  and tedious regulations, which fits in the ninth house nicely.
1991;TRANSIT_0000000000114950;Transiting Mars in your eighth house;In the eighth house Mars can develop in a subtle way. If some impulse makes you want to react negatively you should stop and think twice about it. Especially in this time you could hurt people around you, although you may not even be aware of it. This could bring uncontrollable consequences with it, forcing you to make drastic changes to your life. It may come to conflicts especially in the area of resources which you are currently sharing with others. Before you use brute force to assert your interests, it would make more sense to get a workout in bed. That could calm you down. Just be aware of the fact that in your current state, your strength and energy could easily cause injury to others.
1992;TRANSIT_0000000000098566;Transiting Mars in your seventh house;At this time all forms of human relationships are of special importance. Its a time to learn about mutuality which you arent able to practice without running into problems. It depends on your ability to differentiate which conflicts have to be carried out and which are better left alone, because they could provoke a fight which you would regret later. If you keep cool in this time, then it could bring new life into your partnership. If you arent able to manage that, it could be that you are too attached to your egotistical ambitions. Mars feels at home in the first house, the home of Aries, which is linked to the ego. The opposing seventh house is the house of Libra, which emphasizes cooperation and common goals. Therefore you should try to invest your energy in positive activities together with your partner.
1993;TRANSIT_0000000000082182;Transiting Mars in your sixth house;You can use this period for tackling the tasks you have been putting off for some time. At work, people will notice your sudden diligence, your boss will learn to rely on you during this time. The only catch is that the sixth house is the house of Virgo which stands for the fulfillment of obligations and service to others. Mars association with the ego can cause a conflict of interests at work. However, if you are aware of this and try to restrain your enthusiasm or, even better, place it at the disposal of others, nothing will stand in the way of a positive expression of Mars energies. Otherwise, it could lead you to take on too much and cause you physical suffering.
1994;TRANSIT_0000000000065798;Transiting Mars in your fifth house;"To experience this transit positively, it would be advantageous for you to use the energies at your disposal for creative activities. Mars in the house of Leo denotes a creative constellation. Dont be upset if your romantic inclinations are replaced by unusual sexual desires during this phase, just dont make too many demands on your partner.



The fifth house is concerned with children, which is why you will have to put up with a few conflicts during this time. Maybe you cant get rid off the impression that kids are trying to run all over you and you are determined to assert yourself. Take a deep breath and relax, this problem could merely be a matter of pride."
1995;TRANSIT_0000000000049414;Transiting Mars in your fourth house;Mars doesnt feel very well in the house of Cancer. The warm and receptive principle of Cancer will find itself suppressed and dominated by masculinity. Here the priority is stability at home and if you dont watch out, you can provoke fights within your family. It would be best if you would use your excess energy to decorate your home. Redo your apartment, maybe you have been wanting to for a long time, anyway. Hopefully other people wont hinder you by bringing up their own concepts, because it wont be easy to reach a compromise at this point in time. Possibly you find out at the end of this transit that it isnt always worth it, to insist on getting your way.
1996;TRANSIT_0000000000033030;Transiting Mars in your third house;The third house, associated with Mercury, concerns every kind of communication. You feel a need to discuss and dispute with lots of people. Especially with brothers and sisters and the other people closest to you, although there may be larger conflicts. Once you are aware of this, you can adapt to the situation and use this transit to initiate projects in your neighborhood. It is always better to use energies productively than to waste them in senseless arguments, although conflicts can be seen as something positive once they have been cleared up. All in all, this transit demands an active intellect, which has been waiting to be channeled into the right direction.
1997;TRANSIT_0000000000016646;Transiting Mars in your second house;This period is suited for putting a lot of energy into your business and financial interests, preferably together with many other people. It could be a problem if you act egotistically, trying to get your way at all costs, as this could put others off. Additionally it is possible that you will feel the need to own things which you actually cant afford. The second house is not only concerned with material values, but also with ideals and could lead to confrontations in this area. Keep yourself under control and dont overreact because it may have far reaching consequences which you are as yet unaware of. During this transit you should try to put your resources to good use because greed or envy of people who have more than you do will only lead to disaster.
1998;TRANSIT_0000000000000262;Transiting Mars in your first house;"This period starts when the Ascendant is crossed. This leaves you feeling rejuvenated such as to fascinate the people around you with your energetic radiance, although this may seem strange to you. Use this transit to take on new projects, you can even manage without help from others. This isnt the best time to worry about the interest of other people. If you have to listen to your boss or be more considerate of your partner, you wont be able to avoid complying, but basically you want to give substance to your own ideas.



Finding the golden mean wont be easy. It would be best if your egocentrism could be extended to include charitable works."
1999;TRANSIT_0000000000000326;Transiting Jupiter in your first house;"Jupiter has passed the Ascendant and finds itself in the first house, where the representation and the development of the individual personality are the main themes. As a result of your worrying about yourself, you are able to put your concerns into practice in everyday life, which also gives you the feeling that this is a time for personal growth. Success in your attempts to experience your abilities will provide you with a foundation for their further development. This transit is also suited for changing your appearance which may lead to a weight gain.



Probably you are often lucky, win the trust of others and are greatly appreciated for your ability to take their concerns and needs seriously. If your tendency to exaggerate doesnt win the upper hand, this phase should leave you with renewed energy."
2000;TRANSIT_0000000000016710;Transiting Jupiter in your second house;"This is a period providing you with plenty of opportunity to raise your standard of living. Maybe you will start your own business, which is certain to be successful. Concern for values under moral and ethical standpoints which seem to be necessary to the foundation of life of the average citizen will increase during this phase. Maybe you will begin collecting various things, throwing money out of the window or wallowing in luxury. In any case the expansion in the area of material values is necessary at this time. You should motivate yourself and acquire a wider perspective in order to be successful in business, but you shouldnt overdo it. Some people cant handle their ""luck"" and become arrogant and overconfident. Dont let yourself get conceited, share what you have achieved and you will receive more."
2001;TRANSIT_0000000000033094;Transiting Jupiter in your third house;"At this time you can become the center-point of your neighborhood. The third house emphasizes communication and Jupiter will take care of its expansion. Additionally you will intensify relations to your brothers and sisters and the rest of your family.



In addition, the house of Mercury and the relation between Mercury and Jupiter has always been seen as the sign of literary talent. Even if you werent born an author, it is a good time to devote some time to writing. For example, a medical student working on a thesis may wonder at how easily the words come up during this phase. The third house also denotes short trips; which will present you with a good opportunity to expand your horizon."
2002;TRANSIT_0000000000049478;Transiting Jupiter in your fourth house;In the fourth house Jupiter will make itself as comfortable as possible so that all the aspects of home life are emphasized. An increasing ability to probe the current situation within your family and initiate changes which will have far reaching consequences. This includes investing in your home or acquiring property. If you are a member of a family living together, you will be more generous and your conduct towards your family members will become more loving. Naturally, your parents may also play a large role. The attention from your parents could take on any character or you may support your parents yourself. In any case you will do everything to stabilize your inner basis with the help of a warm home. A recognition of the sense in keeping the family together will motivate you to take another look at older traditions to ensure its success.
2003;TRANSIT_0000000000065862;Transiting Jupiter in your fifth house;"This is a phase devoted to the expansion of your creativity. It isnt easy to describe just how it should appear because it depends on how much interest you bring into this type of activity. The fifth house also stands for children and producing one yourself, would also be seen as a creative act.



The desire to represent yourself, your individuality and living your own life, could lead to some wonderful experiences. Just dont let it get down to founding a personal philosophy based solely on the gratification of desires. A strong radiance lets you feel up to any challenge. In spite of this, it would be useful for you to place restrictions on your ego and work for cooperation. Probably you will develop a new outlook on life during this period and have the potential to enrich it with warmth and concern."
2004;TRANSIT_0000000000082246;Transiting Jupiter in your sixth house;The sixth house isnt Jupiters favorite place, because here effort and exertion are called for, and these arent Jupiters qualities. Jupiter can still work effectively in the sixth house. It would be best if you were to fulfill your obligations to yourself and then think about what responsibility and service to others means to you. Just as a student who must first learn in order to understand the wisdom of the teacher, you will experience intellectual and spiritual growth through work. Possibly you would like to make yourself professionally independent because Jupiter always needs its freedom. Its passage through the sixth and the tenth house is in any case an exceptional opportunity to start your own business. All things considered, the central point is to approach work joyfully, because the sixth house is concerned with health and you should organize your situation to ensure your satisfaction and take care of your health.
2005;TRANSIT_0000000000098630;Transiting Jupiter in your seventh house;"In this period you will be able to extend your personal relationships. An existing romantic relationship can be renewed or maybe you will fall in love often. Your partner will act obligingly and if your relationship is stable, this is a good time to make plans for your future together. It may be that you have been wanting to move in together for a long time or have been thinking of building together.



You are learning now the best way to develop further by looking for contact with others and exchanging ideas with them on every level. Activities together could make an impression on your world view, and probably you are well liked because you are open and generous with others. People know they can do business with you because you arent one who cheats business partners."
2006;TRANSIT_0000000000115014;Transiting Jupiter in your eighth house;Probably this phase will have a positive influence on you because you may receive money or other gifts from all sides. There may be an inheritance waiting for you. No matter what happens, you will look for and ponder its meaning. Maybe you would like to experience something completely different and end up changing your lifestyle dramatically. Your view of the world could become shaken, although it would involve nothing more than throwing outdated ideas overboard. If you make an attempt to purify your thoughts, you wont take anything too lightly, because the process will make you more aware. There is a danger of you becoming fanatic or eccentric, although that cant be reduced to the effects of this transit. All in all, you could learn to deal better with psychological stress and to channel it into productive activities.
2007;TRANSIT_0000000000131398;Transiting Jupiter in your ninth house;In the ninth house, associated with Sagittarius, Jupiter feels most at home because this is its usual place of residence. Here its influence can be expanded. This is an excellent time to embark on a long, distant journey which serves primarily to expand your horizon. You are open for foreign cultures and because this transit will last at least a year, you will have enough time to prepare thoroughly. Additionally you could use this phase to enter new areas of study, preferably those related to philosophy. If you should ever feel the need to find out more about Astrology, go for it, start learning on your own. Basically this house is all about becoming conscious of your purpose within a larger context. If you can get a grip on the intellectual arrogance you have built up, Jupiter will help you to see more clearly.
2008;TRANSIT_0000000000147782;Transiting Jupiter in your tenth house;In this phase you will examine your plans concerning your career. Preoccupied with the way you want other people to see you, you are concerned with how you can best realize your responsibility for others. No matter what you do you will try to find meaning in it, and may even get involved in politics. Probably your boss has realized that you are reliable and that you take your responsibilities seriously, although you noticeably enjoy your work. Possibly you will be rewarded with a promotion or a pay rise. During this transit you can take a firm stand because you have thought about the issues long enough to eliminate the danger of people not taking you serious. Maybe you will get more involved in social issues and you may have already had some success in this area. Additionally, it should be possible for you to improve your relationship to your father, if you had problems.
2009;TRANSIT_0000000000164166;Transiting Jupiter in your eleventh house;"In this period friends will become more important to you as you discover a feeling of camaraderie. The projects you initiate dont rest on deaf ears because you take solidarity and responsibility serious. When you plan outings you put a lot of effort into choosing interesting places and get things moving. The best way to learn, as you have found, is to talk about future developments with your clique which leads to discussions about your differing convictions. At this time you need a large circle of friends to spur you on and bring you into contact with new ideas. This will also lead to new friendships which will serve your further development. This phase will generally include others in all your efforts, as in the saying: ""its your call into the woods that makes the echo."""
2010;TRANSIT_0000000000180550;Transiting Jupiter in your twelfth house;"This transit will allow for introspection. If you find your insides tied up in ""knots"" , it will also help to loosen them. Be prepared to learn a lot about yourself. People will notice your reserved and quiet manner, which may be uncharacteristic for you. A retreat will offer ample opportunity to develop your intellectual capacity, which could include the study of Astrology. Possibly you will get to know someone with whom you will feel somehow connected and who will win your trust. This person could also be yourself.



Sympathy is an important part of you. Jupiter in the house of Neptune will make sure that you come to a deeper understanding of your most sincere feelings and consequently act on them. Instead of taking yourself so serious, try thinking more universally. Watch out that you dont get caught up in harebrained schemes."
2011;TRANSIT_0000000000180614;Transiting Saturn in your twelfth house;The twelfth house is the house of Neptune therefore Saturn wont feel much at home here. While Saturn is concerned with clarity, Neptune tends to cloud things over. This transit could serve as a longer phase of introspection in which you are accountable to yourself. This will prepare you for the time when Saturn passes the Ascendant and enters the first house. It will also cause you to initiate new endeavors consciously and with clarity. Now you should consider everything you have accomplished in the last few years and take a look at everything you have left unfinished. Although you have an increasing tendency to be too critical of yourself, just dont make a habit of it or let it interfere with your contact with the outside world. Some self criticism is alright, but when it starts to look more like self decimation, you should make more of an effort to greet your own reflection with a friendly smile and direct your attention to the future. Accept the fact that nothing you can do will change the past.
2012;TRANSIT_0000000000164230;Transiting Saturn in your eleventh house;"Recent Astrology links Saturn to Aquarius, which is why it feels at home in the eleventh house. Aquarius stands for collective effort and Saturn in the eleventh house will show you better ways to handle communal endeavors. Every time you come into contact with others to work for common goals, the experiences will teach you how to behave cooperatively within a group as long as it lies beyond your professional interests.



If you are successful, you can be sure of winning the affection of the people involved, if not, others will have to make you aware of what you are doing wrong.



All in all, this transit should encourage the development of a group consciousness which finds its expression in integrated activities. Saturn will lead you there in its own way, although it wont necessarily be completely painless."
2013;TRANSIT_0000000000147846;Transiting Saturn in your tenth house;"In the tenth house Saturn feels at home and it is also associated with the sign of Capricorn. Now everything is centered on finding a position in life. How much responsibility have you demonstrated in the last few years? Have you directed your life on to the right path? If so you could harvest the fruits of this two to three year phase and get a clearer image of how your life could look in the future. During this process, your expectations will certainly play a role. If your lifes perspectives havent developed much, you should make up for it now.



Saturns transit through the tenth house can indicate any form of professional advancement. You will recognize what you can achieve and want to make others aware of it. There should be no objections to this in general, but your activities shouldnt take on excessive forms or your body will pay the price for it eventually."
2014;TRANSIT_0000000000131462;Transiting Saturn in your ninth house;During this transit an outlook on life will be created in which you will be able to live in harmony with your environment. Now is the time for you to consider peace and justice not only in your own world but on the whole planet and to consider your image of these two worlds. After seeing yourself as part of a greater whole you will be better able to relax and let things happen. If you arent able to see beyond the end of your nose and to greet others with tolerance and good will, you will be forced to and you shouldnt try to resist. Look for meaning in what you are doing and reflect on events, this will lead you to greater insights and bring you into harmony with your community. A long trip would do you a lot of good, but Saturn isnt necessarily responsible for taking the initiative.
2015;TRANSIT_0000000000115078;Transiting Saturn in your eighth house;"In this time you should come to understand that it is better to live independently of other people and their resources. In classical Astrology the eighth house stands for other peoples wealth. Saturn will show you how you have organized this aspect of your life.



Possibly you are now on your own and find it difficult. If you ever become completely independent you will have lived up to Saturns challenge and you will be in a position to recognize new opportunities in your life. In the eighth house Saturn will force you to make changes in your life, which could take a drastic turn. You wont be able to get out of taking a look at the unpleasant side of your personality, which will also put you under pressure to take some risks. Additionally, you will probably find out more about your own personal needs and your sexuality."
2016;TRANSIT_0000000000098694;Transiting Saturn in your seventh house;"A fourteen year old phase in which Saturn has made sure that your personality experienced fundamental changes because you had to get to know yourself and think about your conduct, is coming to an end as Saturn enters the seventh house, the ""Exodus"" into the other world. During this time you should take a closer look at your relationships. These could be a source of difficulties because you have to learn to see yourself as part of a pair. Consider what you expect from a relationship and what you are able to give. Possibly you will have to overcome inhibitions in order to find happiness with a partner or to get to know people. It isnt necessary to end your relationship, friends can help you to gain insights which will bring your conduct to new depths."
2017;TRANSIT_0000000000082310;Transiting Saturn in your sixth house;In this phase it is important to go about your professional activities responsibly and also to carefully observe your bodys reaction to your various endeavors. In the worst case, you will have to be prepared to learn about yourself while you let an illness heal. Dont panic, but Saturn has more to do with the consequences of poor behavior than any of the other planets. Beware of further signs of danger. This period of time, which will last from two to three years, will serve to improve the quality of your work, without making it perfect. Instead of placing unrealistic expectations on yourself, try to find the golden mean between your capabilities and your boss exaggerated demands. After this transit has passed, you should have gotten to know your true capacities a little better. Insights into this area will automatically reduce the risk of disease.
2018;TRANSIT_0000000000065926;Transiting Saturn in your fifth house;At this time the conceited and more complex sides of your personality will make sure that you dont get caught up in your own ego and lose touch with reality. Traditionally the fifth house stands for all forms of recreation, although Saturns influence may somewhat change them. It may even force you to do without your favorite pastimes or may bring problems which will have to be solved before life can become light and happy again. The fifth house emphasizes everything pertaining to children. If you have children, they may cause you problems during this phase, maybe in the form of a generation conflict. Prepare yourself to do without some of the pleasant things you are used to and come to terms with yourself. This will lead you to an appropriate form of self expression and enable you to devote yourself to creative expression for extended periods of time.
2019;TRANSIT_0000000000049542;Transiting Saturn in your fourth house;"This transit concerns itself with inner stability which should be present at home and can be restructured during this time, if it is necessary. If you have neglected to initiate changes when they were necessary, you may be startled by Saturns drive to get things cleaned up. If you get along with your family and dont run away from conflicts, you shouldnt have any problems. Unfortunately, people tend to deceive themselves in this respect and then run into conflicts completely unprepared. This phase favors constructive new beginnings which will put you in harmony with your life and help you find an honest expression. If you arent in need of it, you will be in a position to take your obligations at home and within the family more seriously and give others a feeling of security.



This transit may cause problems with your parents or maybe they have a problem, which has been waiting to be taken care of. Often parents of advanced age are brittle and are in need of care. This time quality could mark the beginning of such an obligation."
2020;TRANSIT_0000000000033158;Transiting Saturn in your third house;In this two to three year long period, dealing with the people closest to you is the central issue. At this time intellectual resources will be activated and will be observed critically, especially by relatives, siblings and others. If there are communication problems, they will be cleared up. Maybe changes are due in this area and you will realize that it is high time to listen more carefully to what other people want to say to you. This could scare you into keeping quiet in groups, and thus giving the impression of having an introverted personality. All things considered, it could be a productive time, whereby it could be to your advantage to prick your ears and give in to positive changes, even if it is painful at first, as are all lessons in which Saturn plays a role. The light at the end of the tunnel will come when you have learned to deal responsibly with the information you have received and when you have learned when its better to keep your mouth closed. Once you have understood this, you will be able to concentrate on learning and filter the most important elements out of the mass of impressions.
2021;TRANSIT_0000000000016774;Transiting Saturn in your second house;In traditional Astrology this is a time for material losses. But that isnt something you should simply accept. There will be losses in this area only if your outlook on life places your own personal advantages above everything else. This is a longer period in which your experiences will cause you to reconsider your system of values. Even if you have been worrying about your future financial situation, it would be better if you would start thinking about human values. If you concentrate on monetary values, you may lose sight of the important things and then find yourself in financial difficulties. It would be best to organize your bookkeeping so that you can take time for the more important things in life.
2022;TRANSIT_0000000000000390;Transiting Saturn in your first house;"This period of time is clearly intended as a preparation for a new beginning. Saturn has left the twelfth house and passed the Ascendant. The beginning of the first house will probably reveal deficits in yourself. If you want to use this phase constructively, you should think about whether you are able to keep up with your expectations. Some people make their own lives hell for no real reason. A great deal of people who live on this planet arent perfect. It is important to understand this and to be willing to make compromises. The best way to go about it is to follow the principle in the film ""Dead Poets Society""; ""Carpe diem""  ""make use of the day"". Then you will learn that it is better to take on challenges than to passively sit around and wait for better times."
2023;TRANSIT_0000000000000454;Transiting Uranus in your first house;"Uranus will remain in this house for about seven years. As it enters the first house, you may experience some turmoil in your life. This is not only due to the external situation, but you will sense a desire to change yourself; the changes may be external, such as a new lifestyle, or internal, rejecting previous behavior which you have decided to reform. It wont happen overnight, still sudden changes in your life can leave a lasting impression with no way back. You should pay attention that this development remains understandable both for you and for other people in your life. This will ensure that your new outlook on life will be a constructive development."
2024;TRANSIT_0000000000016838;Transiting Uranus in your second house;"The second house concerns your relationship to material things, that means to everything you consider valuable and necessary in order to secure your existence. In this area sudden changes could introduce you to a new understanding. If you manage to react with flexibility which enables you to integrate these changes, this will be a fruitful time in your life and you may initiate fundamental changes in the way you deal with both material and ideological ""property"". If you still find yourself worrying about doubts, surprises and problems, it could be that you are stuck in conventional ways of thinking and are feeling an exaggerated need for security which will only hinder your development. Share your resources if you want to be able to count on the help of others, should you ever run into bad times. If you have the tendency to develop a dependency on other people or on status symbols, Uranus will teach you how to become detached and to feel good about it."
2025;TRANSIT_0000000000033222;Transiting Uranus in your third house;"This phase may initiate changes in your concept of communication. Routine relations with people will be more or less restructured. An emphasis will be placed on your closer surroundings and you may relocate and have to learn to get along in a new environment. At this time you will probably see it only as a burden. Try to direct your attention to the opportunities and think of ""new wallpaper"" as an interesting change of pace. Perhaps you never thought about having to start all over from the beginning, but you could warm up to the idea, and the more that happens, the more your intellect will be stimulated. At the end of the tunnel you will find a new outlook on life which will be more flexible than the old one. Astrological studies could encourage this development."
2026;TRANSIT_0000000000049606;Transiting Uranus in your fourth house;In this period, in spite of all the changes you have been through, you will develop a great interest in finding a safe refuge, where you are able to experience warmth. Now the events will serve to put a new light on your home life and also the contact to your parents. Possibly you will have to move out and make a home in some other place or your relationship to your parents will take on another quality. Possibly you will want to become independent so that you finally have the opportunity to put important changes affecting your new concept of life into practice. Even if, at first, you find it difficult to accept the reforms in your immediate surroundings it is clear that Uranus is doing nothing more than attacking encrusted structures. After some time has passed you will appreciate everything which has happened to you.
2027;TRANSIT_0000000000065990;Transiting Uranus in your fifth house;"With Uranus in the fifth house, you should transform your relations to the opposite sex. The fifth house stands for creativity, pleasure and romantic ""escapades"". You will become attracted to new and possibly exotic recreational activities which will bring you a lot of interesting experiences. Additionally your relation to children could change. Maybe you will suddenly develop an urge to have a child or the children you already have may surprise you with unusual behavior. Still, it is a good time to let yourself be inspired by the children's world. If you have always wanted to be creative, this transit will support your efforts to find a new form of expression. A relationship to someone of the opposite sex which began under this influence could offer you many exciting surprises and wont be easily directed into the usual ruts."
2028;TRANSIT_0000000000082374;Transiting Uranus in your sixth house;This transit is about restructuring your professional situation. If you have been dissatisfied with the work you do to earn a living, you will now be in a position to make some fundamental changes. Especially the authoritarian behavior of your boss will no longer be quietly accepted, so that in this phase it is possible to transfer to a new workplace. It may not be necessary to change your place of work, you may be permitted to exercise more freedom in structuring the work you are already doing. If you have made yourself irreplaceable at work, such that your boss cant do without you, he or she wont let you go so easily, but will probably be understanding about whatever it is that you find fault with. Just be sure that your wishes are realistic. If you sense an exaggerated restlessness and your rebelliousness does nothing more than fulfill a duty to yourself, it could be a sign of inappropriate egotism. This behavior could leave you with an illness which is also a topic of the sixth house.
2029;TRANSIT_0000000000098758;Transiting Uranus in your seventh house;"Uranus will uncover all the latent dissatisfaction in relationships during its transit through the seventh house. Now it's important to develop your partnership and especially your romantic relationships such that everyone involved finds fulfillment. This could consist of ending an existing relationship or starting a new one. In the last case you can be sure of stirring up a lot of excitement. But not only sexual relationships should be carefully considered but also all other human relationships, like business partnerships.



As you love experimenting and are open for everything, the only thing you cant tolerate is boredom. You should become conscious of the fact that deep relationships need time and that you shouldnt be so impatient. It is also important to be careful because you could come to regret spontaneous decisions which cant be turned back"
2030;TRANSIT_0000000000115142;Transiting Uranus in your eighth house;"In the sense of classical Astrology the eighth house stands for the communal resources shared with your partner. Uranus will remain here about seven years and initiate great changes in the above mentioned area, as far as changes are necessary. If you should have made yourself dependent on somebody or something you will notice it with time. The eighth house is the house of Scorpio and Pluto is its planet which is concerned with an intense transformation together with regeneration. Still with Uranus in the game it wont be a subtle process, but rather in a sudden explosive manner, which will also provoke questions of fate. Usually death is associated with this house, but people have gotten away from the idea that it can only refer to an absolute physical death. It may also refer to structures within a persons life which are no longer necessary and when they are changed, it can come to a ""death"" of the old which makes room for something new to grow."
2031;TRANSIT_0000000000131526;Transiting Uranus in your ninth house;"This house concerns the development of ones own life philosophy. It is important to train yourself to think flexibly because Uranus will alter your view of the world. The sooner you are able to integrate the new insights into your life, the easier it will be to draw the right consequences. Uranus will always fight against stagnant thinking, whether you want it to or not, and will always win, unless you are so highly developed that you are in no need of new experiences. If that were the case you probably wouldnt still be living on planet Earth.



During this period, you could suddenly move to another place, maybe even to a foreign country. Spontaneous or long trips could determine your life. If you have always wanted to learn more about Astrology and its related fields then you should go ahead and begin studying on your own. The intellectual stimulation which you receive during this transit is certain to receive adequate reflection."
2032;TRANSIT_0000000000147910;Transiting Uranus in your tenth house;Uranus will certainly create a lot of commotion in this house, which is devoted to finding your position. As you enjoy experimenting with your public influence, you worry about your goals. Possibly you have wanted to change your profession for a long time, but werent really sure about your ability to start something else. If you have always had problems dealing with authority than it will be more noticeable during this phase and it may even come to conflicts with your boss or supervisor. This transit will last about seven years so you probably wont be constantly changing your place of work during this time, however you should structure your professional situation so that you are motivated and your intellect isnt neglected. At work you may be given areas of responsibility. Also it is a good time to make yourself independent. Although you should be certain that you are not acting on a sudden impulse, but have carefully planned your move. In the course of your planning, dont forget to include your parents. They may be especially helpful in your endeavors.
2033;TRANSIT_0000000000164294;Transiting Uranus in your eleventh house;"Within the next seven years your friends as well as your preferred activities could be completely transformed. In the eleventh house, the home of Aquarius, Uranus is at home too. This house is linked to the future but also to your ideals and dreams. Maybe a vision of your future is developing at this moment and is showing you the possibility of leading a life with a completely different orientation. If you feel that these changes would do you good, then let them become more concrete. Allow yourself to react to other ""revolutionary"" tendencies with more flexibility. Basically, its all about getting rid of out-dated behavior. People who come into your life will cause you to try out new behavior. With Uranus in its own house it shouldnt be difficult for you to feel up to the challenges of this process."
2034;TRANSIT_0000000000180678;Transiting Uranus in your twelfth house;Uranus will be in the house of Aquarius for approximately seven years before it crosses the Ascendant and reenters the first house where it will help to find a means for expression for the inside of a person. The twelfth house is associated with any kind of institution, and your relationship to diverse institutions could be overthrown. You may come into contact with prison, even if you dont end up there yourself, someone close to you may. Things could be restructured so subtly that no one even notices. There will be more introspection during this phase which will include contemplation about your role in the universe, although you could approach this with little patience and lack of stability. For this reason you shouldnt take on too much and try to stay relaxed and persevere.
2035;TRANSIT_0000000000180742;Transiting Neptune in your twelfth house;During this period of your development Neptune will travel through its own house, because the twelfth house is the house of Pisces and Neptune. Even if this phase is one of intense introspection that doesnt mean that you will withdraw from daily life for 14 to 18 years. This phase is more about incorporating your insights into everyday life. If you feel inclined to delve into the study of alternative sciences, this is a good opportunity to begin. You find yourself in search of the deeper meaning of existence and its connection to universality. Because Neptune and the sign of Pisces also stand for martyrdom and self pity, you should be careful about your leaning to think you have to put these qualities on public display. All in all the insights resulting from this transit should serve to sharpen your intuition and allow you to rely on your inner voice.
2036;TRANSIT_0000000000164358;Transiting Neptune in your eleventh house;In the classical sense the eleventh house concerns your conduct and your position within various groups outside your professional activities. In an extended sense it will offer a description of the individual ideals concerning living together in a larger family which will describe the people involved as well as their future plans together. This phase is a good time to join a group which deals with spiritual and esoterical matters. As always when Neptune is in the game, it is important to keep a clear head and not to drift off in euphoric illusions. Disappointments are nearly unavoidable. This house position can indicate that you have been disillusioned by your friends or vice versa. If you always try to express yourself clearly and honestly these problems can be avoided.
2037;TRANSIT_0000000000000004;The meaning of the transiting Sun;The Sun moves approximately one degree every day. So it travels through all 12 houses in your chart in a year and emphasizes all the important areas of life one after another. It tells you the areas to which you should devote your attention, tells you about sources from which you can draw energy and tells you about your general concerns. The aspects between the Sun and the planets of your birth chart (especially with the Sun itself) tell us about our state of health. As the representative for your life energy, personality, your will power and self expression, the transit aspects of the Sun also describe your current mental strength.
2038;TRANSIT_0000000000000006;The transiting Sun in your first house;When the Sun is in the first house it has just passed the Ascendant. The first house is associated with the self so that you can count on receiving new energies, which you can probably use. Your own affairs should be very important to you at this time and maybe you will also find answers which you have been looking for a long time. You should have enough strength and energy to present yourself in a positive light and to secure your position in life. Still you should try to maintain objectivity when dealing with others because at this point in time you have a tendency to overemphasize your own problems. On the other hand, this could be a time for you to develop your creativity and maybe even make changes to your self image.
2039;TRANSIT_0000000000003268;Prolog;"We welcome you to the interpretation of your transit chart. Before we go into the specifics of your individual constellations, we would like to begin with a brief introduction.



A transit happens when the planets in their current positions form aspects to the planets in your birth chart. We also interpret current planetary positions in your natal chart houses. The multitude of possible combinations makes of a constant formation of transits, this can be observed in everybodys chart. The transits of slow orbiting planets give the aspects a generational characteristic, because entire age groups are equally effected. The house position of these slow moving transit planets are of special importance and it might be useful to consider their aspects in the natal chart.



How can the interpretations help?



In any case, they shouldnt bring anyone to passively accept the course of events, convinced that they are at the mercy of their fate. We hope that we were able to make clear especially for the more challenging transits, that people have a choice and must accept full responsibility for the circumstances of their lives. Also the interpretations should not serve to prevent people from leaving their house without first making sure that ""the stars are in a favorable position"".



In our opinion it is especially productive to keep an eye on the transits of the slow moving planets because they develop over longer periods of time and usually describe important phases of your life. Their interpretations will therefore be presented in more detail. Does a planet go retrograde, you will encounter the same information three times: when the first aspect forms you will experience something new, it will then be intensified on the trip back and then on the next pass can be put to practical use.



It may be irritating when two or more contradictory interpretations are equally valid for the same transit. This becomes as problematic as the interpretation of the natal chart, due to the computers inherent inability to instill sensitivity into the interpretations. Additionally, everyone experiences different needs and ambitions at the same time occasionally.



We would be pleased if you would find reading this interpretation helpful."
2040;TRANSIT_0000000000000132;The meaning of the transiting Mercury;"Mercury in the houses shows which areas of life you have been learning about and which topics could inspire you even to the point of leading you to do research in these fields. Mercurys transit aspects can help you to recognize the way you confront people around you, how you approach problems and how you structure communicative contact to other people, whereby in classical Astrology your relationships to your neighbors and siblings are of special importance.



If Mercury is in transit with several planets, it will cause excitement and confusion, will challenge your intellect but not destabilize your life. Also shorter trips, which may be for business, are ruled by Mercury."
2041;TRANSIT_0000000000000196;The meaning of the transiting Venus;"A transiting Venus travels through your chart in about a year filling the affairs of each house with a dose of serenity, creativity and sociability. The effected areas should be especially pleasant at that time, even if Venus can cause you to be passive and sluggish at times.



Primarily this planet stands naturally for love and harmony. The transit aspects tell us about the structure of the relationships, if friendships are satisfactory for everyone and about the state of your partnership. The effect should generally be positive, even if Venus in transit is traveling so fast that it only lasts a few days."
2042;TRANSIT_0000000000000260;The meaning of the transiting Mars;"In contrast to the previously mentioned planets, which all travel quickly, Mars needs a little more time to move through a house. On the average it takes two or three months; when Mars is retrograde it may take twice as long.



When Mars is transiting a house it tells in which area you should invest your energy and from where you receive your motivation. Mars gives the energy to live and to achieve. Also sexuality, aggression and achievement are all associated with Mars. Its transits describe the way you go about things; hard and inconsiderate or ""only"" determined and energetic. A weak Mars can make it difficult for you to assert yourself and defend your interests, because you lack faith in your own powers. Mars determines the ""Ego"" of a person, also setting egotistical goals, the root of all evil in our world. Still this energy is necessary to assert yourself and to develop further."
2043;TRANSIT_0000000000000324;The meaning of the transiting Jupiter;"Jupiter remains in each house for up to two years, depending on its size. Altogether one trip through the entire chart takes about 12 years.



Maybe you can experience positive developments in the effected houses, because Jupiter was always considered the great patron, protector and the messenger of good luck. The principle of expansion as well as striving for enhancement in every form are associated with Jupiter. However when it comes to expansion it can quickly become excessive which may be noticeable when it comes in the form of a weight gain. Generally its benevolent effects can lead to sluggishness.



The aspects of Jupiter in transit describe how your outlook on life can be influenced and how you see your role in the universe during this phase, because this planet also stands for the intellectual confrontation with your surroundings on a higher level."
2044;TRANSIT_0000000000000388;The meaning of the transiting Saturn;"Saturn is seen as the ""Evildoer"" in classical Astrology. A more modern view is that it represents a challenge which presents you with an opportunity to develop. Its house position tells you in which area of life difficulties are likely to develop, where your weaknesses are, although it can also bring stability to a situation. In this sense Saturn presents you with the bill for your past behavior, whereby the intensity of the influence of the difficult transit depends on you. Usually it only makes you aware of limitations which you can accept.



Saturns entire cycle through the chart takes about 28-30 years and culminates in the so-called ""Saturn-Return"", the phase in which Saturn reaches its natal chart position. This allows it to remain in each house for two or three years and in this time it is also retrograde. That means, if it enters an aspect to another planet within a house, it will be repeated to time more: The first encounter will call the problems to your attention, the return will intensify the problem and by the third meeting you should have enough strength and maturity to work on a constructive solution and end the conflict.



Finally, it should be emphasized once again that Saturnine experiences can be painful, but must not necessarily be, if you live in harmony with yourself and your environment."
2045;TRANSIT_0000000000000452;The meaning of the transiting Uranus;"The transit of Uranus through your chart makes it possible for you to constantly get to know new aspects of your personality. That may be connected to some of the surprises, which the effects of Uranus will unfold; usually unannounced. Wherever Uranus is found you will be confronted with sudden developments which demand the ability to react with flexibility. You may be experiencing boredom because you have a need to show your other side and to develop your individuality. The drive for independence can become so strong that you surprise yourself and everyone else with unusual actions.



Any discussion of Uranus in transit at this time must mention that it has been in a conjunction with Neptune for some time and that the effects of these two planets are often difficult to combine. This conjunction has been located in the sign of Capricorn for several years, which is associated with political connotations. During this period of time political structures were dissolved (Neptune) and that happened in fall of East Germany rather suddenly (Uranus). These days Uranus moved on into the sign of Aquarius.



The harmonious transits of Uranus will motivate you to turn your attention to the future and to do your best to live in a society characterized by liberty and solidarity."
2046;TRANSIT_0000000000000516;The meaning of the transiting Neptune;"The transits of Neptune are not easy to see through. There are many levels on which it can manifest itself, whereby it remains dependent on the state of consciousness of the individual person. Challenging transits can cause unstable people to feel helpless and insecure, which may lead some to seek help in drugs or in institutions. The positive effects show true sympathy as well as a general sensitivity for everything happening around you. It is also important to be aware that Neptune also creates illusions. Until 1997 Neptune was in Capricorn, where it has been forming a conjunction with Uranus for years. Now it moved on to Aquarius; many people associate its entry into Aquarius with the beginning of the age of Aquarius. 



Its transit through a house will take 14-18 years which should not mean that it exercises uninterrupted influence and that you will be unable to realistically perceive the effected area. Although you will probably notice that with the transition into the next house, you will suddenly be able to judge the events of the previous house more objectively or emotions which had no justification will simply dissolve."
2047;TRANSIT_0000000000000580;The meaning of the transiting Pluto;"Pluto is a planet of violent regeneration. It rules Scorpio, where it has been resting for several years. In 1997 Pluto moved on to Sagittarius. As the most distant planet known to man, it remains in a house for up to 25 years. Due to this time frame, its transit aspects are of particular interest. During the life of an average person, Pluto will travel through three or four houses, this might convey in which areas of life you will make the most extreme experiences. 



In the mythology of India, Pluto corresponds to the goddess Shiva, capable of destroying everything in order to rebuild. Pluto brings death but also life. This does not necessarily refer to the physical death, but usually means philosophies of life and forms of conduct which are simply no longer useful and are ready to ""die"". In its transit through the houses, Pluto will create violent changes. As a demonstration of its effects remember that Pluto was discovered in 1930. At this time the first atoms were being split, this led to the catastrophes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which marked the end of the second world war.



Generally Pluto transits should motivate you to rethink your conduct and eventually make changes before you are forced to."
2048;TRANSIT_0000000000016390;The transiting Sun in your second house;"Currently your primary concern is improving your income, although you would also like to think about the meaning your possessions have for you. Possibly you try to free yourself from the obligations of everyday life concerning money, property or other valuables. You could learn not to overestimate the material aspect of life and share your resources with needy people. In this context ethical and moral questions can become more meaningful for you.



Maybe you will acquire things which you have been planning for a long time. Rethink your attitude toward money and possessions - you could have fruitful insights."
2049;TRANSIT_0000000000032774;The transiting Sun in your third house;The third house stands for communication both generally and within your closest relationships. The Sun in transit emphasizes the everyday relationship to neighbors, siblings and friends. Probably you are now ready to take a closer look at the way you treat other people and maybe make some changes. Presently you are sociable, curious and entertaining, which is why it is easy for you to find the right words. You should open yourself to others and if you want to devote yourself to new fields, don't hesitate. Just pay attention that in conversations you give others a chance to talk. Don't try to always be the center of attention. Keep calm and stay in the background. Let new information take effect, that never hurts anybody. This transit will stimulate your intellect, so that you can let yourself get into unusual situations.

It asks the question if you fulfill your obligations willingly and are prepared to take on responsibility. After the sweet transit through the fifth house the Sun will present you with the challenge of taking care of your obligations and dealing with the consequences of your actions. Now you have the chance to recognize the meaning of your work and deal rationally with the challenges of your daily life. If you are not in tune with yourself and are trying to avoid your obligations and deny assistance to others, this could make itself noticeable on the physical level in the form of an illness. Maybe you have conflicts at work, although you should now have enough energy to convince others of your point of view, because this transit should provide you with mental clarity."
2053;TRANSIT_0000000000098310;The transiting Sun in your seventh house;"This house concerns itself with the challenge of communal and social mutuality. During this transit your relationships will take center stage, especially your relationships to the opposite sex. An existing partnership can become more important to you or you may enter a new relationship. This is the time to rethink your behavior towards others and bring fresh wind into your partnership. Being aware of your constant dependency on the cooperation of others, allows you to appreciate the situation. Your role in the community will become more conscious which is why you will probably be able to reconcile conflicts between others.



Intensify your contacts which have been important to you in the past. If you are in negotiations, this transit will contribute to their success."
2054;TRANSIT_0000000000114694;The transiting Sun in your eighth house;"The eighth house is associated with Scorpio. In this phase you will get deeper in to your psyche and your spiritual life. Even if your daily obligations keep you from taking time for your self, you should try to find the golden mean, which will allow you to find the balance between your own needs and the needs of others. Personality traits which you dislike may come to the surface. Don't try to suppress them but learn to accept this part of yourself. When you manage this you will return to a state of inner harmony.



Almost everyone has had unpleasant emotions which just won't disappear, but talking to other people about it will quickly confirm that it is part of being human."

It is time for expansion on all levels, the time is also favorable for learning something new. Also a trip would do you good, or a seminar or an adult education course could set things in motion for you. Possibly you will meet people who come from far away and provide new insights into foreign cultures.

Go for it, this favorable time will support your efforts."
2056;TRANSIT_0000000000147462;The transiting Sun in your tenth house;In the tenth house the topic is the challenge to define your position in life. This includes your profession as well as your social status and all your activities which place the building of your character in the foreground. It can be important for you to rethink your goals and to examine how far you have already realized them. Still the connection between Capricorn and the tenth house should make Saturn's qualities noticeable now, which is why you probably take your responsibilities serious and have no problems missing out on some recreational activities. You should try to see your role within the larger system realistically. At this time the most important task is to find your strengths and weaknesses and explore them.
2057;TRANSIT_0000000000163846;The transiting Sun in your eleventh house;"The eleventh house is related to everything beyond the career and home life which is important to you. Especially the groups which you see daily and spend your leisure time with. You will make new friends and see old friendships differently. This will help you to recognize the values which are most important to you and to see how much you have in common with your friends.



The eleventh house is the house of Aquarius and the planet Uranus. Sudden transformations may come about by abstract causes and new group projects can arouse your interest. You should use this time to question your previous behavior and work on initiating sensible changes for the future. Think about what you could do for your community."
2058;TRANSIT_0000000000180230;The transiting Sun in your twelfth house;"The twelfth house is the home of Pisces and the planet Neptune. Use your energy to see your inner being and make behavior which was previously subconscious transparent. Even if this seems vague and impractical, this can be a time for getting in touch with yourself and your dreams, visions and fantasies. Although it may not be easy, it is immensely important because relations to others are often determined by subconscious signals. We often ask ourselves why we provoke a certain reaction from people although our intentions were quite different.



The time for this transit is appropriate for introspection. The Sun has traveled through all the houses of your birth chart and before it reaches the Ascendant where a new year will begin, you should take a look at what has happened in the last twelve months and draw consequences if necessary. This should be well considered and not come about out of a sudden impulse."
2059;TRANSIT_0000000000180358;Transiting Mercury in your twelfth house;"This is the time when Mercury finishes its transit through the houses and your concentration turns inward. The twelfth house stands for withdrawal for contemplation and reflection; so your ego shouldnt be overemphasized. In this phase you should look back on the past year and prepare Mercurys entrance in the first house, after it crosses the Ascendant. Get in touch with yourself and find out what is important and what you want to work for in the future. Maybe you will encounter characteristics which have been hidden until now.



Sometimes it is useful to retreat and meditate. You have to decide for yourself how you want to go about it, but you should definitely take time out for relaxation in a tranquil setting and find yourself."
2060;TRANSIT_0000000000000134;Transiting Mercury in your first house;Mercury has passed your Ascendant and you might be more occupied with your own points of view than before. You have more dialogs with yourself and talk to others about yourself as well. Intellectually stimulated, your reason is operating at full tilt. It will be important to deal with yourself honestly, although it may be difficult. If you exert yourself you will advance in this area. It would be good if you were to initiate activities which you have been intending to take on for a long time and through which you hope to develop. Still you could easily let yourself be distracted and get out of breath half way there. Concentrate on the important things, that is what will bring you to new insights about yourself.
2061;TRANSIT_0000000000016518;Transiting Mercury in your second house;"Mercury in the house of values and possessions tells you that you are concerned about your income and security. Financial affairs should be integrated into this phase, you probably have come up with a lot of new ideas in this area.

This will bring you into contact with people who make you feel at ease. This is not necessarily the time to make new decisions, its more pressing to recharge your mental battery and to keep your thinking flexible. Neighbors and all your relatives, but especially brothers and sisters may play an important role in this process. If you are able to limit your enthusiasm and euphoria, you should be given enough energy to tackle the tasks awaiting you.
2063;TRANSIT_0000000000049286;Transiting Mercury in your fourth house;In this period of time you will become more aware of the need for spiritual and mental stability.

Life at home will receive special attention in this phase, but dont hesitate to make your observations from a safe distance, it wont do you any harm. If you live with your family, you will be able to make plans efficiently or talk about things that have happened which caused tension or which were especially moving. The fourth house is associated with Cancer, which means you may start to dig up your past or follow up on one of your dreams.

2067;TRANSIT_0000000000114822;Transiting Mercury in your eighth house;"This transit should enable you to gain insight into the depths of your psyche. You want to get in touch with yourself and are in a position to see and understand the workings of your innermost being. The eighth house is seen as the classical ""house of death"" and associated with the sign of Scorpio. Maybe you have come to realize the cycles of eternal life and dying. It could concern a discarded concept which should be revised. The planet Pluto is at home in Scorpio so that it is probably easy for you to divorce yourself from outdated ideas.

No matter what interests you at the moment: take time for it, even if it extends beyond the transit.



If you have ever thought about alternate ways of living, dont hesitate to learn more about them. Allow yourself to take a personal philosophical view of your affairs."
2069;TRANSIT_0000000000147590;Transiting Mercury in your tenth house;Here you will have to think about your position in society. You are planning your career and are in a position to reconsider your ambitions and eventually make some changes. Responsibility will probably play an important role. Frequently opportunities for a month of advanced training may be fruitful if you take advantage of them. When something like this presents itself, dont hesitate to register voluntarily. Also preparation for exams is under a favorable star, because you can express your thoughts structured and clearly and arent afraid to speak in front of an audience.
2070;TRANSIT_0000000000163974;Transiting Mercury in your eleventh house;The eleventh house is traditionally a place for groups. Mercury emphasizes confrontations about every day conditions at work and leisure activities. What do you do after work? Who do you spend time with? Are you satisfied with your friends? These kinds of questions should be emphasized because this is the time to get clear answers. Your endeavors in this area can be supported by seeking an exchange with the people you choose to spend time with because they make you feel comfortable. Its important to do things with others and to get out and meet people. If friendships develop depends on your stamina, Mercury doesnt have any thing to do with that.
2071;TRANSIT_0000000000180422;Transiting Venus in your twelfth house;"This transit could possibly give you the urge to support people who are suffering. Possibly it will get to the point of self sacrifice, still before making statements of this nature the other transit factors should be taken into consideration. In this case you should try to judge correctly and provide help for self help, or you could find yourself being used. Venus in the house of Neptune sometimes conjures up dreams of the selfless salvation of lost souls, and you should not expect to be thanked for your efforts.



On the other hand, you may be inspired to give your creativity free run and will probably wonder how much talent is slumbering within you. At this time you are especially vulnerable and should therefore postpone difficult confrontations."
2072;TRANSIT_0000000000000198;Transiting Venus in your first house;"After Venus has crossed the Ascendant it will move through the first house and cause you to pay more attention to your appearance. With the amount of charm and radiance you display, you should feel fortunate. Now you can enjoy taking care of yourself and treat yourself to something. A new hairstyle or buying new clothes could be fun, or even a make over, just dont overdo it. As always here it is important to find the golden mean.

2073;TRANSIT_0000000000016582;Transiting Venus in your second house;"During this transit financial affairs shouldnt be neglected, you should pay attention to the way you use your resources. Venus home is the second house because it is linked to Taurus, the second sign of the Zodiac. If you have opportunities for improving your financial security, which are probably due to your charm, make an effort to withstand the temptations of a life of luxury, even if you can think of a few things you would like to own.



In order to give in to all of Venus temptations in this house, you would have win the lottery. If you keep this in mind and if your system of values contains a benevolent but not necessarily egotistical relationship with people, you will be able to live through this phase without stress."
2074;TRANSIT_0000000000032966;Transiting Venus in your third house;In this phase neighbors, relatives and siblings will play an important role for you. It brings you great pleasure to talk to them or just have fun together. Maybe you will plan an outing with your brothers and sisters or throw a party for your neighbors. In either case you will have a good time. With your friends you are laid back but sometimes you are amazed at how charming you can be in conversations. Now is the time to let people know how much they mean to you. A positive response should reach you before too long.

2075;TRANSIT_0000000000049350;Transiting Venus in your fourth house;While Venus is moving through the fourth house, you will have a lot of fun with the people who you feel closest to, concentrating your attention on beautifying your home and spending many quiet hours on your couch, completely contented. If you entertain guests, which you should, they will certainly compliment the decor you have put together with a lot of love. If you havent heard anything from your parents for a long time, then it is becoming time to invite them over. It is sure to be a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere. As by many Venus transits, be sure that the enhancements to your surroundings dont put a strain on your budget.
2076;TRANSIT_0000000000065734;Transiting Venus in your fifth house;"Here Venus is in the house of Leo. You want to enjoy the finer things in life and put an emphasis on beauty, art and entertainment. Maybe your sudden impulse to go to the theater or a concert will bring you to discover your own creativity. Just be careful not to neglect the demands of every day life and not to let yourself get too comfortable. You could simply take a vacation and spend time being lazy and having fun. This phase favors creative and artistic activities. Interaction with children could become important to you because you are increasingly able to understand how children feel; you also dont like being forced into things and refuse to take life seriously. Venus in the fifth house encourages getting involved in new romantic relationships or bringing new excitement to an existing relationship."
2077;TRANSIT_0000000000082118;Transiting Venus in your sixth house;The sixth house is not exactly the place where Venus feels most at home. Here there is an emphasis on everything having to do with work and responsibility. Theres not much room for fun in this period. Once you understand that, you can begin to use this time to bring creativity into your workplace while trying to beautify it. You should be capable of talking openly to the people you have something to say to, maybe colleagues will become friends. Most likely you are equally popular with the managers and your colleagues because you create a relaxed and encouraging atmosphere. If there are problems at the office, you can count on your charm to get around them. Depending on whether you put in a request or not, a pay rise or a promotion could result.

Maybe it is a good time to make peace with someone who you have had problems with in the past. If you are single and dont want to give up your lifestyle, you should take special care not to fall in love during this phase, since this transit is favorable for new romances."
2079;TRANSIT_0000000000114886;Transiting Venus in your eighth house;"This transit most clearly shows the sexual side of Venus, here in the house of Scorpio. Probably you will intensify your sexual contacts and find pleasure in physical closeness. It should be easy for you to find fulfillment in losing yourself in a relationship. You could playfully make new experiences which will leave a lasting impression on you. However, there is an ever present danger of excess which you wont always be able to get a grip on. So try to keep your feet on the ground in spite of all the passion.



In the classical sense the eighth house is devoted to resources of other people, so that it could be supportive of your efforts to acquire credit or to reach a financial arrangement which you have working on for a long time."
2080;TRANSIT_0000000000131270;Transiting Venus in your ninth house;"The time of this transit is especially suitable for a long trip to visit foreign cultures which will expand your horizon. You are open for new thought and like to devote yourself to existential questions, without getting too serious about it. Cultural aspects are especially interesting to you. Maybe you are interested in the history of art, lesser known religions or questions of faith. Your interest is very sincere, which everyone around you notices; they also enjoy listening to your explanations.



Probably you can grasp the background and the fundamentals of Astrology fairly quickly. With a great interest in exercising your higher intellect, all efforts in this respect should be productive."

People appreciate your efforts to create harmony and your loving radiance has the effect of attracting other people. You have no problem making a positive impression even on large groups of people and acting as expected at any event.



On another level, you could improve or intensify your relationship to your parents. Maybe you could visit each other or plan an outing together. In any case it should be a loving atmosphere where everyone can have fun."
2082;TRANSIT_0000000000164038;Transiting Venus in your eleventh house;You are looking for fun and relaxation in activities, which go beyond family and work. You want to enjoy life together with your friends and are ready to join a group and make any compromises which seem to be necessary. New recreational activities and contacts are planned, so that you can expect to win new friends during this period. Maybe you will find a partner in your clique. You radiate warmth and charm which makes you a welcome guest. If there is a fight in your surroundings, you are able to negotiate because you can understand both sides. An ability to recognize how you can best serve your community makes you feel at home.
2083;TRANSIT_0000000000180486;Transiting Mars in your twelfth house;Mars trip through your chart is approaching the finish line. Before it begins the cycle again, it will have to cross the hurdle of the twelfth house. It would be ideal if you were to use this phase for energetic introspection. The best way to go about this is something you will have to decide for yourself. Some retreat to a Buddhist monastery and maintain silence for ten days. This doesnt necessarily have to be your approach, but you have generally less strength and energy than usual and should therefore give yourself a rest. This time will be put to the best use if you reflect on where your energy is being channeled and consider if helping others wouldnt have positive effects. This phase is both a conclusion and a new beginning.
2084;TRANSIT_0000000000164102;Transiting Mars in your eleventh house;"In this phase it will be important to intensify all your contacts outside your professional interests. The drive you put into planning recreational activities could do a lot for your friends, like when you reserve accommodation and plan outings. Still you have to be sure of remaining focused on the interests of the group as a whole and not just serving your egotistical aims. Everything is more harmonious when individual wishes or general interests are considered in the planning.



The eleventh house is associated with Aquarius, therefore the time has come to think about making plans for your future and its larger context; plans which can be formulated and then put into action."
2085;TRANSIT_0000000000147974;Transiting Neptune in your tenth house;This phase of your development concerns your professional orientation and your conduct in public. Possibly it is difficult for you to follow one path consequently and to believe in your goals. As is always the case when Neptune is in the game, you first have to find out what you can achieve under the given circumstances and separate realistic goals from dreams. Of course this isnt intended as a general condemnation of dreams, you should allow yourself to dream once in a while, even in the context of your profession, still in the house of Saturn decisions are generally made on the basis of reason and that isnt exactly Neptunes style. Maybe you will be involved helping others get back on their feet or you find some other sensible activity. In any case you will recognize the true meaning of your work and that it can help you lead a satisfying life.
2086;TRANSIT_0000000000131590;Transiting Neptune in your ninth house;"In this developmental phase Neptune is moving through the house of Sagittarius. This is concerned with spiritual experiences and the resulting changes to your outlook on life. Maybe you should learn more about Astrology and related fields. Astrology is certainly not inept at helping a person understand himself and to define a place within the workings of the universe. In humanistic Astrology the ninth house is seen as ""the test of ones significance"". There a person can find out about his uniqueness and his relationship to the great family of mankind. This learning process will bring insights into the need to take responsibility for oneself and there are still other important principles outside this sphere of influence which one must submit to. Maybe you will take a long trip sometime during this phase. This would be a nice treat to yourself because you are especially receptive to impulses from foreign cultures."
2087;TRANSIT_0000000000115206;Transiting Neptune in your eighth house;"In this time you try to sound out your innermost being, but you could be deceiving yourself. You want to track down the secrets of life and recognize your place in the universe. Because you are sensitive to hidden subconscious realms you could devote yourself to ""esoteric"" studies. In any case it will involve a longer developmental phase while you collect experiences and hopefully will see more clearly in the end. Slowly but surely old, tired out structures will die out making room for a new order in your life.



It would be best if you were only to acquire things which you can really afford. Dont get overconfident, but calculate carefully. Otherwise you could misjudge a financial transaction and end up with less than you invested."
2088;TRANSIT_0000000000098822;Transiting Neptune in your seventh house;"This transit will have brought some clarity into your relationships. You will learn to see others, especially your lover, not just through rose colored glasses but complete, with all the weaknesses. You will probably make some painful experiences on your way there or you will be frequently disappointed, still this will serve your understanding of human nature, so that you will be able to better rely on your judgment. It is important to speak open and honestly, you should avoid keeping secrets.



Perhaps it is also a time to come into contact with drug addicts or criminals. Or maybe you or your partner will be seen in the totally wrong light and will have to constantly deal with misunderstandings. In any case you should internalize something about human interaction during this long phase. Probably you can sense intuitively which contacts do you good and which people it would be better to stay away from."
2089;TRANSIT_0000000000082438;Transiting Neptune in your sixth house;"In traditional Astrology the sixth house emphasizes two areas, work and health. In this phase, lasting quite some time, you will be able to find out what is good for you and what isnt. Ideally, at the end of this transit you will have worked out a nutritional approach which will serve for the rest of your life. Neptune is also lord of ""reality warping"" substances, or drugs. It would be useful to find out to what extent frustrations drive you to an intoxicated escape from reality and which substances take you there. Now dont panic, this doesnt necessarily imply a dangerous drug addiction, it concerns nothing more than your behavior when you are disappointed. Concerning your livelihood, you will make best use of this transit if you choose a profession devoted to the general well being."
2090;TRANSIT_0000000000066054;Transiting Neptune in your fifth house;In this phase you will be on the lookout for spiritual and romantic lovers, with whose help you will try to express your own individuality. Although relationships begun under this influence could have a shadowy aspect about them. Possibly you excessively idealize your partner such that a closer look would burst the bubbles you let grow so big and beautiful. If your heart is in it and you can defend your behavior, at least to yourself, you will easily be able to get through all the dangers of this transit. Seen positively this Neptune position should initialize a development which ends in finding adequate expression for your creative capacities, which you werent even aware you had.
2091;TRANSIT_0000000000049670;Transiting Neptune in your fourthh house;"When Neptune is in the fourth house it will spend many years working on stability at home. Neptune has some ideas about how such a home might look. But you should watch out that your plans concerning your family and home arent too idealistic; a shot of reality is part of the deal. This is a slow process which will eventually allow you to see clearly, which you will need in order to take charge of your life from a secure foundation. On another level the fourth house emphasizes your relationship to your parents. Probably you will be able to define your bond to them more clearly than you could before."
2092;TRANSIT_0000000000033286;Transiting Neptune in your third house;"This transit initiates a phase of development in your communicative behavior. Clarity by overcoming doubt could be your motto. For an example look at the first 14-18 years of life during which a person develops her self image. It grows primarily out of contact to brothers and sisters, which are also a topic of the third house.



On another level, thought itself is transformed. It could possibly do you good to research the ""esoteric"" side of life in order to come to grasp that each individual person represents nothing more than one minuscule unit within the context of the infinite universe. Once you have understood this you can create a secure foundation, free of illusions, in the following transit through the fourth house."
2093;TRANSIT_0000000000016902;Transiting Neptune in your second house;In this phase Neptune will bring you to examine your attitude towards material possessions. What kind of a relationship do you have to your property? Are you hung up on dreams, do you give in to illusions? This may involve dubious investments which promise more than they can deliver. If you spend the whole week planning how you are going to spend your lottery winnings and then suffer disappointment when the winner is announced, that is the kind of behavior we are talking about. The second house also stands for a persons system of values and Neptune will bring you experiences which will guide you away from doubt and towards certainty. Neptune is no evil force, but relishes temptation.
2094;TRANSIT_0000000000000518;Transiting Neptune in your first house;Neptune in the first house will cause many changes in your external and internal personality which will be difficult to figure out. In this period you will get to know yourself better. Thereby many facets of your personality will be brought to the surface, which Neptune will try to use to further your development. If Neptune didnt have such a strong predisposition to dreams and illusions, this process could be brought about quickly and painlessly. In other words the image you have of yourself does not necessarily conform to reality so that you will be constantly replacing it with another until you have learned to recognize and accept yourself together with your needs. On the other hand, your sense of perception often proves itself to be very useful.
2095;TRANSIT_0000000000000582;Transiting Pluto in your first house;In this phase of development you have the chance to bring about changes deep within yourself. This procedure will be rather subtle but can lead to outbreaks of energies especially if Pluto runs into aspects with other planets on its trip through the first house. Pluto senses power hunger as well as a desire to destroy and rebuild, therefore, you should watch out for a tendency to want to control or manipulate others. Because the first house is about the ego, Pluto will drive you to your knees for as long as it takes to reform your ego so that it meets with the demands of your community. You will get to know yourself and then get a better grip on your life by the end of this long transit.
2096;TRANSIT_0000000000016966;Transiting Pluto in your second house;"Humanistic Astrology refers to the second house as the test of possessions. Here all kinds of values are concerned. On its long trip through this house Pluto can bring about changes in your financial situation. This phase may begin with a financial collapse and result in an overthrow of your personal system of values. Most people agonize over such experiences, but the saying ""rising like a phoenix from the ashes"" didnt come from nowhere. Pluto is destructive but also enjoys rebuilding. Finally, it will initiate a new orientation to your materials and fundamental ideals."
2097;TRANSIT_0000000000033350;Transiting Pluto in your third house;It isnt easy to describe the Plutonic energies in the houses. Some of the statements made up until now have been harsh, although it is clear that there wont be daily uprisings during this period of time. In the third house the immediate surroundings, the daily routine, thought and communication processes are at home. Because this long developmental phase is devoted to these areas, fundamental changes may result. One or more changes in residence may be included in the deal, as well as more intense contact to neighbors, brothers and sisters. Your concept of communication will be regenerated by the challenges during these long years. Finally it should be possible for you to approach people in a way that will leave them with a positive feeling.
2098;TRANSIT_0000000000049734;Transiting Pluto in your fourth house;The home and being together with the people who live there could reach new emotional depths during this transit. Especially if Pluto forms other aspects on its trip, it could come to disruptive events in your life, such as building a house or transferring your base by moving to a new place. The inner psychological ravages which will slowly start to come about are even more important. Finally, it will come down to the establishment of your way of life. This will happen in a way that will stand the greatest challenges. On this level, the answer may come from your parents.
2099;TRANSIT_0000000000066118;Transiting Pluto in your fifth house;"Humanistic Astrology refers to the fifth house as the test of purity. That may sound strange when in classical Astrology in the fifth house everything is concerned with pleasures, creativity and children. Actually a person with Pluto in transit through this house will begin to reflect about what pleasures are all about. Especially if Pluto runs into aspects with other planets, it may alter your attitude toward enjoyment and self representation. Purity in this respect doesnt necessarily imply joining a monastery. The question is more the purpose these activities serve. Pluto wont concern itself with frivolous matters also pride and inappropriate conceit will have no chance at this time. Expect to do a lot with children during this phase; they may not necessarily be your own. That should keep you flexible, but often it is from kids that you can learn the most important basic lessons of life."
2100;TRANSIT_0000000000082502;Transiting Pluto in your sixth house;You will have some experiences which will be important to you by devoting yourself to your work and paying more attention to your body. This holds especially true for Plutos aspects. Pluto doesnt form an aspect with another planet only once but three times, first on the way there, next on the way back and then forward again. Therefore Pluto in this house can lead to severe health problems and also to disturbances at work. But only if you have neglected to arrange for special clarity in these areas. If you are able to understand the connections and with no false adornment fulfill your daily obligations, Pluto will reward you greatly with the most valuable gift imaginable, good health.
2101;TRANSIT_0000000000098886;Transiting Pluto in your seventh house;The seventh house is the house of relationships. Humanistic Astrology assumes that conformity and contradictions are tested here. Pluto will provoke excitement in all of your relationships during its long trip through this house, especially if it forms an aspect to another planet. Possibly you have an inclination to want to exercise power over people and if that is the case, some day you may be forced to reconsider if you want to continue initiating endeavors without the support of others. Relationships lacking a firm foundation could break up completely, whereas others may be intensified. The trick is to work out a concept for relations with others which both sides can relate to. At the end of this transit you should have learned your lesson about cooperation.
2102;TRANSIT_0000000000115270;Transiting Pluto in your eighth house;"In the eighth house, the residence of Scorpio, Pluto feels at home. On its long journey through this house it is concerned with the transformation of the self. Topics such as death and reincarnation will be emphasized here. Especially if Pluto forms aspects with other planets in this house, things could happen which will force you into a confrontation with death. This wont necessarily concern your own death; it could just as well call attention to itself in your environment. For someone who enters this transit at 60 years of age there is certainly a possibility to die. Everyone has to greet death someday, and with Pluto in this house one will be intensively prepared for it and will be able to depart in peace. Studying the so-called parapsychological and esoteric sciences, including Astrology, will make deliberation of this topic easier."
2103;TRANSIT_0000000000131654;Transiting Pluto in your ninth house;"In this portion of your life you will experience which role you play in society, even if it wont be possible without sacrifice or painful experiences. For Humanistic Astrology the ninth house stands for the test of ones own significance. How seriously do you take yourself, both as an individual as well as within the context of the entire universe? Thinking about these kinds of questions will probably bring you to change the orientation of your outlook on life to conform to the changing circumstances.



The ninth house is the house of Jupiter which is often prone to exaggeration. Especially if Pluto forms aspects to other planets during its long trip through this house, it can come to an excessive perspective of your own opinions. Still Pluto will make sure that pride comes before the fall. In the sense of classical Astrology the ninth house emphasizes consciousness expanding trips. Even if you dont live out of a suitcase for 25 years, travel under a Pluto aspect may be profound and bring deep insights with it."
2104;TRANSIT_0000000000148038;Transiting Pluto in your tenth house;"For Humanistic Astrologers the tenth house is a place for the test of ones ability to find a position in life. The tenth house is the home of Capricorn, the sign of (political) power. Pluto will help out with turbulent events during its long journey through this house supporting you to define your position in life. Especially if it forms aspects to other planets, you may make significant changes to your lifes goals. Pluto can obliterate existing goals but also assist the creation of new ones. If you arent working towards anything in particular, you will be amazed at the way new perspectives develop over the years. Finally, watch out that you dont use your power potential for egotistical purposes, this will diminish Plutos ""escapades"" to some extent."
2105;TRANSIT_0000000000164422;Transiting Pluto in your eleventh house;The eleventh house is the residence of Aquarius. According to traditional Astrology the topics are group activities, collective interests, ideals, hopes and a persons vision of the future. Possibly you will throw many of your opinions overboard during the course of this phase of your life, especially if Pluto forms aspects with other planets in this house. Also your circle of friends is subject to changing influences, provoking basic changes in your activities outside of work. The ideals for which you were actively proselytizing yesterday may have no meaning for you today. This era will teach you more about your collective significance. How painful these lessons will be lies on your ability to place a higher priority on community than on your own ego.
2106;TRANSIT_0000000000180806;Transiting Pluto in your twelfth house;During Plutos long trip through the house of Pisces, hidden complex facets of your personality will be brought to light. Experiences made during this phase will provide answers to mysteries, especially if Pluto forms aspects to other planets in this house. This refers to a regenerative transformation of your own psyche. Pluto encounters the illusory and clouded tendencies of Neptune, the planet of the twelfth house. This may cause confusion due to the contrast between the subtle ways of Neptune and Plutos directness. Hereby Plutos most important task is to enlighten the hidden subconscious character traits which foster inhibitions and transform them into conscious action. Therefore it is also important to look into the past because therein lies the key to the events which will eventually lead to solutions.
2107;TRANSIT_0000000000000002;The transiting Sun in Conjunction with your Sun;"Your birthday is either today, tomorrow or yesterday; many happy returns. Of course you know how it is to be the center of attention for a brief period; tanking up energy for a fresh start of the next year. Its your own personal new years eve celebration. Hopefully you feel joy and satisfaction because a birthday is a special event. Many people reflect back on the previous year and use the occasion to plan what they would like to do with the coming 365 days. Also you are good at getting your way, especially since the birthday kid is usually granted special privileges."
2108;TRANSIT_0000000000065538;The transiting Sun in Sextile with your Sun;About two months before and after your birthday, this aspect appears in your birth chart. Two months after your birthday you can tell if the changes you decided to implement can stand up to the test of reality. This transit, which lasts about two days, invites you to join others for common activities. Now it may also be two months before the next year of life and you will be able to see more clearly where things got hung up in the last year and find a way to redefine your goals.
2109;TRANSIT_0000000000032770;The transiting Sun in Square with your Sun;About three months before and after your birthday this aspect will appear in your chart. A square aspect usually brings challenging situations with it. Possibly you will meet someone who will cause you to doubt not only what you are and also brings you to put yourself in doubt. If this causes a crisis or not depends on whether your goals, your opinions and that what you do can stand up to serious scrutiny. If you act in harmony with the cosmic energies this aspect will provide you with fresh wind.
2110;TRANSIT_0000000000049154;The transiting Sun in Trine with your Sun;About four months before and after your birthday this transit will appear in your birth chart. The Sun enters this harmonious aspect together with a related sign. During this time you will feel good and want to relax. People around you have no problems with you and group activities will also be harmonious. A high energy level will put you in a position to set a satisfactory course for the next month. If you should determine that not everything in the past has gone as planned, you can do something to change that.
2111;TRANSIT_0000000000016386;The transiting Sun in Opposition with your Sun;About six months after your birthday this aspect will appear in your transit chart. This opposition aspect tells of your personal climax for the year and you will probably be confronted with challenging circumstances. Maybe you will meet someone who will cause you to seriously doubt all your development of the past year. If you know what you are doing, you will be capable of asserting yourself. If not, it may lead to a minor crisis in which you will have to examine if your ambitions and your conduct can withstand a serious challenge.
2112;TRANSIT_0000000000278530;The transiting Sun in Opposition with your Moon;"In this phase your will and your life energy will confront your emotional world; you will be challenged to think about whether you are emotionally in tune with your ambitions. The Moon also stands for the situation at home. Possibly there is a minor disagreement at home, but never fear, this transit wont bring anything Earth shattering, only a short period where in your own feelings with respect to the way you conduct your life are made conscious. If you have difficulties expressing your feelings, give yourself a break today and withdraw to contemplate. This transit is too short-lived to leave a lasting impression, but you will see clearly, that you are up to the challenges of daily life."
2113;TRANSIT_0000000000262146;The transiting Sun in Conjunction with your Moon;At this point your will and life energy will meet up with your emotional world and you will find out to what extent your ambitions are in tune with your feelings.

If you usually have difficulties being open and honest with others, you will be amazed that today you will be able to overcome your inhibitions. Still this transit is too short-lived to leave a lasting impression."

Somehow you want to confide in others and try to get involved in deep conversations. Possibly you cant see your position very clearly which confuses others. At this time you find it difficult to concentrate; it would be better to allow yourself a few hours of rest in solitude or go out and enjoy yourself. Even if listening to others isnt your strong point right at the moment, you should do your best because this is one of the challenges of this transit. Satisfying communication includes the art of giving your undivided attention to someone else, today you may find listening to others animating."

Possibly you wont see your positions clearly; you will confuse people around you.

It may be that you are simply indecisive and sense a deep insecurity. You feel best when you neglect your own interests and work for the general good. In this area you could be effective, but should watch out that you dont let yourself be used. If Neptune has a favorable position in your birth chart, you will have the ability to finally realize the dreams you have been holding onto over the years. If its not too elusive, you may feel the presence of a power at your side which will provide an extra dose of energy when you need it.

Seen negatively, you could be prone to arrogance at the moment and see only your own interests.

Generally it will be difficult to maintain harmonious relationships with others. There may even be conflicts in your partnership which will cause you to be amazed at your partners self-confidence.

If you feel that you are not fulfilling your potential and you dont have external stimulation, you could become moody, start complaining and stir things up at the office. To avoid this, try to drop out of group projects and work as independently as possible.

Some may think that this is exaggerated because Jupiter represents the principle of expansion which overshadows your entire personality and can prevent you from seeing details.

Just remember that this transit is temporary and afterwards youll have to get by without Jupiters help; it would be better not to get careless and to keep both feet on the ground.

2359;TRANSIT_0000000000590146;Transiting Jupiter in Sextile with your Mercury;"During this phase your intellect will be motivated by Jupiter's positive energy. This will be especially noticeable in your heightened desire to talk. Conversation will provide a rewarding exchange of ideas and will keep you open to other views. People will appreciate the precise way you use language. Your conversational needs go beyond everyday topics, get to the core of things and break taboos in your search for truth. An interest in philosophy and history as well as a critical view of the world will help you develop your own ideas about reform. Maybe you feel called to write your ideas down and get them out to more people. Go for it! Nothing can go wrong now that you have realized that you will never stop learning.



Make use of your ability to orient yourself quickly and go into new areas, because there should be enough fields which interest you. If it is important, you should have the capacity to negotiate business agreements well during this transit and be able to turn a profit."
2360;TRANSIT_0000000000557378;Transiting Jupiter in Square with your Mercury;"In classical Astrology, this transit brings the danger of biting off more than you can chew and promising more than you can deliver. This doesn't come out of bad intentions, but simply from a tendency to throw big words around and use superlatives frequently. It is basically due to a desire to avoid dealing with trivial matters. During this time you may not be the most pleasant person because you tend to dominate discussions and to take your contributions to the discussion far too seriously. You may be criticized for being arrogant and some people may start avoiding you because of your incessant lecturing.



Should it come to that, you will have to make some changes to your behavior. Respect other people's right to make their own decisions and don't try to convince everyone else of your way of thinking. You will have an opportunity to learn more about tolerance, even if a few unpleasant comments are necessary to initiate the learning process. Still you should feel fortunate that your attitude is especially positive, hopefully not just because you are good at putting unpleasant realities out of your mind. This period offers a good opportunity to continue your education and to ponder on philosophical issues."
2361;TRANSIT_0000000000573762;Transiting Jupiter in Trine with your Mercury;"During this phase your intellect will be motivated by Jupiter's positive energy, which will be characterized by a heightened need to communicate. You enjoy conversation and exchange with others and are open to other opinions. People will appreciate your precise use of language. Your needs go beyond everyday occurrences and get to the core of the matter. Your search for truth will lead you to break taboos on your way to explore philosophy, history and the social sciences. It may even seem to be the right time to write down your ideas and share them with a larger group of people. Go for it, because nothing can go wrong now that you have realized that you will never stop learning.

2362;TRANSIT_0000000000540994;Transiting Jupiter in Opposition with your Mercury;Under this transit you will come up with a lot of new ideas, although you will have to examine them for reality content, because in this phase your spirit is on the move. Also because this is a challenging transit, you won't be able to realize every idea that comes to your mind. Once you have filtered your thoughts, gather the more useful ones together, you may even want to start writing about these, in order to express your view of the world adequately and find people who are willing to listen. Since you have a lot to say, you will have to be careful to take it slowly, not trying to say it all at once or take on more than you can handle or make promises that you are unable to keep. Start small and develop your ideas bit by bit. This will enable you to make your positions clear in discussions and explain your attitudes toward life without giving lectures. It will also give you the opportunity to further develop your ideas without running the risk of annoying people by talking too much. This period will provide you with the opportunity to continue your education and ponder philosophical issues.
2363;TRANSIT_0000000000803138;Transiting Jupiter in Opposition with your Venus;"Even if this transit is challenging by nature, it doesnt necessarily have to come to disasters. Probably, you dont feel up to taking your fate into your own hands preferring to sit passively and indulge in the pleasant side of life. At the moment you have little interest in fulfilling obligations or concentrating on work and should hope that your colleagues dont suffer from your negligence. It may be a good time to take a vacation, since you know exactly what to do with your leisure time.



The need to remain free and independent could come into conflict with your longing for the warmth of other people. Having a tendency to be wasteful, you may overextend your means in order to finance your hobbies, especially since you insist on making a show of your valuable art objects.



In spite of all of this, the transit could be quite pleasant, if you take careful note of the problems mentioned. Your open and positive attitude could make you a few new friends. But that will only come to pass if you participate actively instead of passively reclining on a sofa."
2364;TRANSIT_0000000000835906;Transiting Jupiter in Trine with your Venus;"This period could lead to especially wonderful romantic experiences. You will be spending a lot of time with members of the opposite sex and also tend to flirt a lot. Under this transit you will be especially attractive which will be noticed by people around you. If you dont have a serious relationship, this would be a good time to find a new lover. An existing relationship can also receive new impulses. Maybe a wonderful vacation is in store for you.



People will notice your openness, understanding and good wishes, so you will be able to make friends easily. Generally, you are in tune with the pleasures of life and are not inclined to sit in an office taking care of boring routine work. You would much rather develop your sense of aesthetics as well as your appreciation for art and music and make your surroundings more beautiful, which may involve acquiring works of art such as paintings and sculptures. This interest may turn you into a passionate collector of beautiful artwork."

People appreciate your understanding, tolerance and good will, making it easy for you to find new friends and intensify existing friendships. Generally, you are tuned into the joys of life and have little interest in fulfilling obligations or working intensively. Watch out that you don't neglect responsibility and risk losing sympathy. During this phase your interest in the arts will be heightened and you may start decorating your surroundings with works of art like paintings and sculptures. Possibly your interest will turn you into a passionate collector and enable you to become knowledgeable in the area. Take care to avoid becoming pretentious or getting into debt. This transit may lead to beautiful romantic experiences. If Venus is in an unfavorable position in your birth chart, you could overdo it in this respect and have many ""irons in the fire"" at once. People are probably appreciative of your charm and generosity but dont appreciate the strenuous conflicts between you and your spouse."
2368;TRANSIT_0000000001048898;Transiting Jupiter in Conjunction with your Mars;"The transiting Jupiter allows Mars energy, which is usually egocentric, to appear in a more friendly light. This period will make you feel energetic, such that no task will seem too large, or too difficult. Unfortunately, this may lead you to overestimate yourself. Be sure not to let your increased strength get you over your head and leave you disappointed in the end. If you take the initiative now, you can motivate others, because people like to follow you since you provide your projects with a far reaching background and enjoy explaining it to others. When you succeed in watching out for all the details, you may be capable of accomplishing a lot. You believe in your goal, which is the secret to your success.



You need a lot of freedom in this transit and hate to let yourself be restricted by authorities. This may seem pedantic and inhibiting, still it is important to consider carefully whether you are right before you get yourself into a conflict. If your own development is to be the first priority, you will never be completely free of restrictions."

The balance you are able to maintain between self-development and consideration for others will give you a good feeling every morning when you look in the mirror. Dont allow your healthy self-confidence to lead to overconfidence. The good luck you will encounter in this period will help you to achieve what you set out to do. Demonstrations of initiative will be promptly rewarded. Also you are capable of recognizing opportunity and taking advantage of it. But it is very important that your successes will not only benefit yourself, but also many others. This may earn you the support of an influential person.

Make sure that you dont take on too much and end up disappointed.



You will take the initiative and be able to motivate people, as long as it is not some kind of a harebrained scheme.

Be warned of strenuous physical activity. You may not have your strength under control and may tire yourself quickly or come on too strong, recklessly knocking others out of your way. An athletic competition can easily become a serious matter. You may want to chose a sport where you are separated from your opponent by a net at least."

If you arent careful, people will be put off by your unwillingness to rethink your position and take smaller steps. Conflicts may arise as well as the loss of the ability to perceive reality as it is. This may also have an effect on your finances.

If your outlook on life happens to be incorrect, it may make conflicts worse if you arent willing to rethink your position and take smaller steps.

You need to overcome your inner inhibitions, explore new territories and generally further develop yourself.



If your life has been fairly easy up until now, you will be able to provide a spiritual background for your efforts.

Due to the challenging nature of this transit, the process of transformation will hardly proceed without creating tensions. There is also a danger of becoming confused for a period of time. Of course the solutions must first be sought and found within yourself. Therefore you should carefully weigh all the pros and cons before you integrate any new elements into your life and toss the old overboard.

Probably you lament about the state of society before you have any alternatives to offer.



Possibly you desire to be free, but dont know what freedom looks like. The privileges you demand tend to be self centered, which doesnt earn you much sympathy from others. It would be better to take time to consider what you would like to change and which changes are feasible, before placing bees into other peoples bonnets. This transits greatest challenge is to keep a cool head. Make use of opportunity without neglecting your responsibility if you want to profit from it."
2384;TRANSIT_0000000001884482;Transiting Jupiter in Trine with your Uranus;"During this time you will probably make drastic changes to your attitude towards life.

Because this is an harmonious transit, you will hardly run risk of overestimating yourself and your efforts will be characterized by a farsightedness. There is also no danger of your plans being reduced to chaos by impatience, because you are aware of the ill effects of a lack of restraint.



Feel fortunate that in your endeavors Fortuna has her hand in it making everything take a turn for the better.

You are looking for an opportunity to be of service or are beginning to get involved in the causes of disadvantaged minorities. The demand for social justice may call for extraordinary action. Actually you are more interested in testing your limits and finding out which space you can claim. If you dont watch out, you could start acting like a rebellious child, indifferent to the cost of getting his way.



Although you have the well being of humanity at heart, you could be prone to ignore your every day obligations and cause problems for the people around you. Maybe you set your goals high, but wont allow concrete assistance to restrict your freedom. If that is the case, somebody is sure to call it to your attention.



When Jupiter enters the game, you should expect to have better luck, and with Uranus, the luck will come suddenly. There are probably many new opportunities open to you because you are striving for further development and are open to changes. Take advantage of the opportunity and dont forget your obligations, then you will be sure to profit from this transit."
2388;TRANSIT_0000000002097474;Transiting Jupiter in Conjunction with your Neptune;"During this time your antenna will be fine tuned to other peoples problems and you may even develop a philosophy of life around helping the needy. You devote your abilities and all of your good will to those who are less fortunate. This will earn you the respect and sympathy of others, although whenever Neptune is involved there is a danger of being taken advantage of. Your outlook on life could move toward religion and mysticism as you represent such high ideals as selflessness and community and strive to further develop yourself by overcoming your most basic needs. Probably you will devote yourself to inner processes during this transit. This will only become critical if you deny your individuality and try to become a martyr.



In this period you will discover your sensitive side and will start to pay attention to your dreams, to write poetry or study music. Anyone who needs you will find you ready to listen. Hopefully, you will be able to rely on others in your time of need as well. If you keep your feet on the ground and remain true to yourself, you will find tranquillity and also make others happy."
2389;TRANSIT_0000000002163010;Transiting Jupiter in Sextile with your Neptune;"During this time you will formulate new human ideals which you would like to integrate into your life. This is already characterized by the sensitivity with which you approach the problems of other people. Neptune represents sensitivity and Jupiter expands on it, such that you could make a philosophy of life out of giving assistance to those in need. A desire to be needed makes you determined to realize your ideals; at the moment that is more important than any egotistical interests. Possibly you lack the drive to realize your visions, but even if they remain in your imagination they wont do anyone any harm.



Probably you have been learning more about the holistic aspects of life and would be willing to approach some of the esoteric fields, whereby Astrology is exquisitely suited to adding another perspective to life.



Use this transit to look inside yourself and meditate on your role in society. Postpone all business transactions for the moment because worldly affairs could make you a victim of self delusion."
2390;TRANSIT_0000000002130242;Transiting Jupiter in Square with your Neptune;"Even if your senses are finely tuned to other peoples problems, there is a danger that your point of view isnt realistic enough to determine which dreams and ideals can be integrated into reality. Jupiter could give your imagination wings to take to unimaginable heights, although some people wont appreciate it and may even be put off by your unworldly affectations.



Helping the disadvantaged could even become a philosophy of life, but make certain that your assistance is appropriate. There is also the danger that others will take advantage of your kindness. Your outlook on life could come under the influence of religion and mysticism. Just be very careful because this transit could lead you to follow a phony guru.



During this time you will learn to differentiate between reality and your wishes and ideals. Dont let yourself get involved in experiments and listen to people you trust when they reflect on your behavior. It would be nice to discover your sensitive and creative side and build on it."
2391;TRANSIT_0000000002146626;Transiting Jupiter in Trine with your Neptune;"During this time you will formulate new human ideals which you would like to integrate into your life. This is already characterized by the sensitivity with which you approach the problems of other people. Neptune represents sensitivity and Jupiter expands on it, such that you could make a philosophy of life out of giving assistance to those in need. A desire to be needed makes you determined to realize your ideals; at the moment that is more important than any egotistical interests. Possibly you lack the drive to realize your visions, but even if they remain in your imagination they wont do anyone any harm.



Probably you have been learning more about the holistic aspects of life and would therefore be willing to approach some esoteric fields, whereby Astrology is exquisitely suited to adding another perspective to life.



Use this transit to look inside yourself, to meditate on your role in society. Postpone all business transactions for the moment because worldly affairs could make you a victim of self delusion."
2392;TRANSIT_0000000002113858;Transiting Jupiter in Opposition with your Neptune;"Even if your senses are finely tuned to other peoples problems, there is a danger that your point of view isnt realistic enough to determine which dreams and ideals can be integrated into reality. Jupiter could give your imagination wings to take to unimaginable heights, although some people wont appreciate it and may even be put off by your unworldly affectations.

You could represent an extreme position and become eccentric, but you will develop such a thick skin that other peoples inability to comprehend wont bother you. However, if you arent in harmony with yourself and your surroundings Pluto will give you an unpleasant reminder of the fact that other humans inhabit this planet besides you. Jupiters expansion principle will make sure your experiences leave an impression.



Dont overestimate your possibilities and try not to see things so bitterly. You wont find perfection anywhere and you are no super hero. Therefore you should be generous enough to forgive yourself for a small slip up once in a while. Keep cool and try to express your feelings."
2394;TRANSIT_0000000002408770;Transiting Jupiter in Trine with your Pluto;"You have a drive for making changes and may even want to completely transform your life.

You may be extreme, but thanks to the harmonious nature of this transit, you wont become embittered. Even if people think that you are hard on yourself, it isnt as bad as it seems; Pluto works on deeper levels and demands that existing structures be rearranged in order to rise up like a ""Phoenix from the ashes"". 



Your determination may be marked, but not to the extent that you want to control and manipulate your environment. That wouldnt help your career moves and you know it. Finally you ""only"" want to do something useful and find the naked truth.

In your view of the world, weakness and sympathy have no place, you can even be cold hearted to yourself. Your overemphasis on determination can become a problem because you have a tendency to manipulate others and put them under pressure.



In a positive sense, you ""only"" want to finally do something useful and to find the naked truth. These insights will change your thinking and your goals and enable you to find productive and creative ways. You have enough energy to realize your goals, but whether having your requests heeded is best for you will always depend on your attitude and your motivation.

2398;TRANSIT_0000000009175362;Transiting Jupiter in Conjunction with your Ascendant;This conjunction will send Jupiter on its way through your birth chart from the beginning. You should be provided with the best starting conditions. Your confidence, sovereignty, helpfulness and openness will make some new friends for you. Possibly they will be influential and can help you acquire certain advantages. Good will come of this only as long as you remain free of expectations and these people value you for you being the person you are. As you bask in your success and enjoy the ease with which everything seems to be running, including the attention of your environment, dont let yourself get overconfident and expect everything to remain this easy!

You may profit from these, but only as long as you remain free of expectations and these people really value you for yourself.

A spirit of freedom should be instilled in your relationship where each has enough self-confidence to trust the other.



Generally all human relationships will be under a favorable star, and you will often be offered exactly what you can make the best use of. You will meet people who are conducive to your development and have a positive attitude toward you. This may bring financial advantages or business relationships which prove to be profitable."
2403;TRANSIT_0000000009453890;Transiting Jupiter in Opposition with your MC;"During this time, you probably feel that your professional development is stagnating but it makes being home all the more pleasant. Your worries about your family fall on fertile soil and continue to develop in your subconscious. Their roots have been stimulated and will take on new importance for you. Since Jupiter promises luck, you should be able to enjoy some pleasant hours with your loved ones. Allow yourself to take more time for your family and to let closeness develop. Maybe you will redecorate or build a new house. This transit is favorable to such actions.



Possibly contact to your parents will be intensified, perhaps you are helping them out of a complex situation or may clear up some misunderstandings."
2404;TRANSIT_0000000009486658;Transiting Jupiter in Trine with your MC;During this time you are confident that your career is advancing and may well make some new acquaintances who will be helpful to your advancement.

Somehow your work just isnt satisfying any more and you would like to change things, if you only knew how. This is enough reason to put everything you have into finding work that means something to you and that you can be proud of. Dont let your inferiority complex get you down again, because finding something is probably all up to you. Be confident, but dont use your horoscope as an excuse to go overboard. If you have wanted to go into business for yourself for a long time, then this transit is the perfect time to do it, however, you will have to carefully consider if your plans will stand up to reality. Both expansion and striving for independence are under a favorable star, and Jupiter promises luck.

Others notice your serious attitude and your patience but you are appreciated most of all for your reliability. There may be a promotion or a raise in store for you, although the fruit of Saturn's works often cant be harvested until later. In any case you know what you want and are willing to accept restrictions.



On the other hand Saturn doesnt tolerate sloppiness, so that you will have to be prepared for professional problems if you havent been working carefully and correctly in the past. Maybe you feel overworked or suffer from a lack of time for your private life. In any case you will have to consider decisions concerning your career carefully."
2408;TRANSIT_0000000001835394;Transiting Saturn in Conjunction with your Uranus;"Under this transit you will have to accept some restrictions to your freedom, as unpleasant as it may be. Perhaps you want to break out, leave your boring routine behind you and get out of your obligations, but Saturn wont let you get away with it. You will only be successful if you consider every change carefully and have good reasons for implementing them. Although Uranus energy is directed towards creating new circumstances through sudden changes, you shouldnt get excited about decisions which you havent thought through, because that will only lead to a crisis.



During this time, your ideas probably wont generate as much excitement as they usually do, but this may also be a sign that they are realistic and can bring about improvements. A willingness to take risks will maintain a balance with reason, which is why you may trust your intuition. If you sense impatience or dissatisfaction you may experience a phase of inner tension caused by indecisiveness in which nothing anyone can do will be able to please you. Possibly it hurts you that you cant be very open with the people around you, which at the same time enables you to work through your experiences in an appropriate manner in relative seclusion and allow yourself to enjoy some peace and quiet. Now you are more critical than usual, and you see your friendships and your leisure activities without rose colored glasses. Make use of the time to recognize lasting values and to prepare decisions thoroughly."

This is a mixture which may make you happy: although you know exactly what you should do with your spare time and are also open to new friendships. Your boss cant complain because you do your work thoroughly and correct. Tradition and progress don't contradict each other because you recognize that innovations are based on what our forefathers built and that a coat of bright paint isnt enough to change history.



Even if you try to make changes during this phase, they will be well thought out and moderate. One of your strong points is your creativity which enables you to work well with your colleagues. An ability to remain open without being naive will offer some immunity to grave disappointments. It wont be difficult for you to live in old structures because these will give you enough freedom to try everything out which seems interesting at the moment. Others are able to convince you of their convictions, because you are honest and are also able to admit weaknesses. Dont let this transit pass by without putting its potential to constructive use."

This will probably be an intense working phase, which wont call for ideals but only for pure necessities. Maybe you feel torn, and apprehensive about being manipulated into structures against your will. These tensions can manifest themselves in sudden rebellion, which wont get you anywhere. It is necessary to place obligations above individuality and wait patiently for better times. Show some respect for the opportunity to learn a lot about yourself, even if it is unpleasant. Maybe you will be able to produce some achievements to be proud of. If you intend to make some changes to get you out of your rut, consider your actions carefully and dont use extreme measures.

Probably you feel that you are always coming up against hurdles. Nothing is working like it should, which makes you feel insecure. You have to work hard and prove your performance constantly, although successes are rare and these bear no relation to the effort involved in bringing them about. Exhaustion, physical weakness or illness could do their worst. Possibly old inhibitions may surface which limit your achievements. Or you are afraid to open yourself up and admit your weaknesses to others. Conflicts with your father or with other authorities may arise; either because you dont want to accept restrictions and obligations or because you are actually being incapacitated. The greatest problem is that you could lose your self-confidence and be subject to additional failures.

Use this transit to take care of obligations you have been putting off and to work on concrete projects. Now is the time to build a foundation which will stand up to future crises. Because the Sun finds itself in a transit, you can develop your personality and explore your maximum level of achievement at the same time.

Probably not everything is running as you had hoped it would, but this is precisely what will help you to recognize what you are actually capable of. Possibly, you feel that your entire personality is inhibited and insecure. This may be caused by external circumstances, but you may be making things difficult for yourself. Now you are challenged to bundle all of your energy and concentration for one specific purpose. Dont disappoint yourself; accept the challenge.



If you dont get discouraged, then this transit will simply be a work-intensive period, during which you will have to sacrifice some pleasures in order to taste the benefits at a later time. You will get nothing for free, but may hope that your hard work will be rewarded and grant you more self-confidence. Patience, perseverance and discipline will receive new meaning for you during this transit. Because you arent in the best health, it is very important to pay attention to your bodys signals.

2418;TRANSIT_0000000000262530;Transiting Saturn in Conjunction with your Moon;"This transit indicates a serious if not depressive mood. You may detect exaggerated self doubt and increased conflict with negative aspects of your personality. Maybe you feel worthless, lonely and unloved. You are most inclined to withdraw from the outside world and give in to your self pity. That would be the worst way to deal with the challenge of this transit. If you want to use it constructively, look inside yourself and come to terms with your emotional state. Seen in a positive light, this is an opportunity to analyze your feelings with no artificial embellishments and to find out just how much everything really means to you. You can clear up problems in your relationships without rose colored glasses or overwhelming infatuation, because you are now ready to make emotional sacrifices if any should be necessary.



Another phenomenon of this transit is a tendency to think about the past and long for it to return. That could keep you from perceiving the opportunities offered in the present. Usually the ""good old days"" werent so pleasant as we remember them because everyone is inclined to suppress bad experiences. Try to stay sober during this time and dont act in a self destructive manner. This will encourage emotional maturity which is a good basis for a new initiative."
2419;TRANSIT_0000000000328066;Transiting Saturn in Sextile with your Moon;"This transit indicates a somewhat more serious mood, which you will be able to put to good use. As you work through your recent experiences you will find it easier to dispense with your rose colored glasses. Without being over zealous or coming under the influence of some overwhelming emotion, you are trying to find yourself and harbor the intention of doing some emotional ""house cleaning"". People appreciate your consideration for their feelings. If you are not generally subject to moods or sudden emotional outbursts you tend to keep yourself under control. This period would be a good time to take a closer look at your emotions and to find out how much everything means to you. If you want to get away from something or someone, go ahead and do it without feigning self pity. Possibly you will seem somewhat spaced and colder than usual, although you havent changed, you just dont respond to sentimentality. When you are ready to comfort someone or offer to help, then it is someone who deserves the attention. Conflicts will be easily worked through because your perception isnt blocked by personal or emotional involvement. You get along with your family, which is a relief because they are important to you during this transit."
2420;TRANSIT_0000000000295298;Transiting Saturn in Square with your Moon;"This transit will bring a serious, if not depressing mood. Possibly you will feel worthless, unloved and isolated from your surroundings. A deep insecurity could take hold, robbing you of your joy. Fears and inhibitions which you thought had been overcome, suddenly appear again and make it difficult for you to open yourself to people you love and trust enough to talk about your problems. Since emotional ties to the world have somehow been broken misunderstandings and tension have developed. Basically you dont feel at home with yourself. Problems with your family or emotionally trying obligations could crop up. You may have to care for a member of the family for an extended period of time which will leave you with little personal freedom. Dealing with women during this time will be especially difficult; the Moon represents women.



Get over your inhibitions and accept help from others. Dont withdraw to wallow in self pity but be determined to master the crisis. Celebrate small successes and dont close your eyes to the beauty of life. Then you will be able to leave this dark valley behind you."
2421;TRANSIT_0000000000311682;Transiting Saturn in Trine with your Moon;"Under this transit you will be able to satisfy most of your emotional needs, which is largely due to the fact that you know what you need.

Possibly you will feel worthless, unloved and isolated from your surroundings because you have suppressed your feelings, or still are, and are paying the price for it.

2423;TRANSIT_0000000000524674;Transiting Saturn in Conjunction with your Mercury;A very restricted perspective can make things difficult not only for you but also for your environment by leading to intolerance and stubbornness. Possibly you will constantly remain critical of yourself although you dont feel comfortable with it and sense that a lot of good opportunities are slipping by. Your thoughts wont be particular positive, although you will be able to concentrate, a certain lightness and joy will be missing. In another aspect, you wont be getting into risky endeavors or put your house and home at risk. During this period you will take more time to consider important decisions. It would be best to use this transit to find out more about what the people around you really think and to learn to communicate more clearly. If you dont feel much like talking and have trouble expressing your thoughts, it may help you get over that. Try to get a grip on the eternal guilt complex and do everything to stay aware of the pleasant side of life. You have enough self discipline to restrict yourself and ban all thoughts which are too pessimistic.
2424;TRANSIT_0000000000590210;Transiting Saturn in Sextile with your Mercury;"In this phase, you will appreciate having an extraordinary ability to concentrate. Mental discipline, attention to detail and a talent for organization are the attributes associated with this transit. You may discover a talent for managing or find a solution to a problem which has been giving you a headache. Because you are very aware of your intellectual capacity you wont hesitate to accept responsibility for your projects. Taking care of concrete matters will have priority; you wont go around chasing fantasies.



Because you are certain not to overlook the small print and because all the details are important to you, you could take care of business deals which have been in the works for a while or make investments. You arent easily impressed, dont let yourself be lead on and can weigh decisions carefully.

2425;TRANSIT_0000000000557442;Transiting Saturn in Square with your Mercury;This transit represents intolerance, exaggerated precision and mental inflexibility. You are convinced that nothing escapes your attention, although you often cant see the forest for all the trees. It is difficult for you to recognize larger connections because you lack objectivity and are preoccupied with details. During this time you could have communication problems. People have trouble understanding your way of thinking and because they are overly critical and are prone to take everything apart, you wont find much sympathy. Maybe your views are old fashioned and arent in tune with the times. Some people have the impression that your own dissatisfaction is your motivation to make life difficult for others. Your demands on others are exaggerated, if you dont ease up and learn to laugh at a joke once in a while, you will soon be feeling lonely. Dont lose your sense of humor and learn the art of conversation. If you didnt take everything so seriously or insist on being exact, you will master your intellectual challenges.
2426;TRANSIT_0000000000573826;Transiting Saturn in Trine with your Mercury;"In this phase, you will appreciate having an extraordinary ability to concentrate. Mental discipline, attention to detail and a talent for organization are the attributes associated with this transit. You may discover a talent for managing or find a solution to a problem which has been giving you a headache. Because you are very aware of your intellectual capacity you wont hesitate to accept responsibility for your projects. Taking care of concrete matters will have priority; you wont go around chasing fantasies.



Because you are certain not to overlook the small print and because all the details are important to you, you could take care of business deals which have been in the works for a while or make investments.

Possibly you will have to fulfill social or family obligations which restrict you and disrupt your enjoyment of life. It will be more difficult than usual to come into contact with others. Everything will be a little more serious and often end with disappointment.



Either you expect too much from others or you are put under too much pressure. Relationships which arent based on mutual respect and honest affection wont stand chance during this transit. It may seem like the relationship was ended by external circumstances, but be aware that you created these circumstances. You arent open for the pleasant side of life, because everything that is fun quickly seems to be superficial. It may even come to people avoiding you because light conversation is so difficult for you and you arent much in the mood for laughing and joking any more either. All of that can lead to inhibitions or fears about meeting new people. Being the center of attention in a large group of people makes you feel insecure; you also feel uneasy when others expect you to be charming.



Dont isolate yourself again, but have faith in your friends, who arent going to let you down during this difficult phase. You have to make an effort to show your feelings. You should not bury yourself in work and neglect romantic relationships, because after this transit you will regret it."
2429;TRANSIT_0000000000835970;Transiting Saturn in Trine with your Venus;"This transit will leave you little time for superficial enjoyment; you will prefer to be involved with people. There will be time to reflect on friendships and to think about which people are the most important to you. It is possible that you will learn a lot from the people of different age groups who will come into your life. You will be supported and will know how to act in society.



Obligations to your lover or business partner will be fulfilled conscientiously. As long as no one tries to take advantage of you, you will remain loyal and upright. Bonds of friendship wont be unnecessarily placed at risk, because you are aware of your charm and its effectiveness at arousing sympathy. Perseverance and your ability to concentrate give your creative work a certain depth. You will hardly fall head over heals in love or see your relationship through rose colored glasses. If problems arise in your relationship, the chances are good that you will be able to find a reasonable solution accommodating the needs of everyone involved. It is important to you to give your partnership a stable foundation and to clear up misunderstandings. This may not be the most romantic period of your life, but you will be able to avoid unnecessary conflicts and disappointments."

It is difficult for you to be lovable or to express positive feelings. Especially in relationships, people find you cold. Superficial friendships dissolve, mostly because you arent very much fun. In extreme cases relationships and long-standing friendships may fail, if it is clear that they arent strong enough to weather tests. By and large this is a pleasant transit which can bring fruitful insights into your expectations of others and your role in society. Even if your thoughts are plagued by strong self doubt, you will still be able to differentiate true friends from false.



Your creativity seems to be inhibited. Generally you wonder why some pastimes used to be so important to you. But dont worry, your joy of life will come back and allow you to recognize that you can overcome crises. Possibly, the effect of this transit will seem less destructive merely by bringing you the ability to avoid falling head over heals in love with the wrong person."
2433;TRANSIT_0000000001048962;Transiting Saturn in Conjunction with your Mars;"This transit can have many different effects, depending on the persons work ethic and level of energy. Generally, Saturn will concentrate strength. If you are involved in many activities all at once you wont get anywhere. If necessary Saturn will slow you down forcing you to choose your goals carefully and to work hard at them. During this period you will be able to master tasks which demand organizational talent as well as correct procedure. Probably this transit will be a challenge. Even if you are ready to throw in the towel, you will have to show that you are disciplined enough to continue working hard. That would only make things worse because Saturns challenges should be accepted without hesitation. If you fight your obligations, it will lead to conflicts with others who will deal strict and mercilessly with you.



Avoid conflicts with people you like because your tact isnt up to it. If you are willing to work hard and accept restrictions, this transit will bring out your best side. Have faith that there will be easier times ahead."
2434;TRANSIT_0000000001114498;Transiting Saturn in Sextile with your Mars;Under this transit you wont act without support or without careful consideration, but concentrate your activities on concrete goals. Knowing what you want and what you are capable of as well as stamina, hard work and the ability to concentrate will bring you much success. Because you arent intimidated by the thought of putting in long hours your career may well advance a few steps up the corporate ladder. In spite of your ambition, you are very capable of cooperation because your vision isnt restricted to your own interests. You could serve as an example and an inspiration to your colleagues because you never ask others for anything which you arent prepared to give. Any restrictions brought about by professional obligations, such as overtime, are taken in stride. As far as your cooperative energies are concerned, they have satisfied every expectation. Probably you have developed an interest in athletic competition. The ability to accurately judge how much energy you can afford to invest in a particular activity will ensure that you dont overdo it and that you pay attention to your bodys signals.
2435;TRANSIT_0000000001081730;Transiting Saturn in Square with your Mars;This transit can be very frustrating, because success seems to evade you, in spite of a lot of hard work.

On top of all that, you are constantly being endowed with new responsibilities although you are already overburdened to the point where you are ready to throw in the towel. Others are not exactly on good terms with you because you are inclined to act in your own best interests and can be rather tactless about it. You simply arent cooperative and try to fight your way through on your own. You may feel insecure because your sexual interests arent very clear at the moment or you are too inhibited to practice sexuality and suffer from fears of failure. Being inclined to self doubt and temper tantrums, it is important for you to watch out that you dont take out your frustration on the wrong people and get involved in acts of violence or cause an accident.

This will enable you to find fulfillment in your work or to integrate the concepts of responsibility and obligation into your outlook on life. How this will look in the end is entirely up to you. If you continue to chase after pleasures, Saturn will force you to change your philosophy of life and confront serious matters. Saturns effects may be strong enough to weaken your self confidence and induce a feeling of inhibition, or your material restrictions may force you to abandon your true values, such as solidarity and friendship.



You have the chance to stabilize your spiritual foundation and to fill it with whatever content you wish. If you are honest and fair to yourself and to others, the positive aspects of this transit should be dominant. If, however, you refuse to take on responsibility, hurdles will be placed in your way which you wont be able to overcome."

Although it is of great significance it effects the life of each person somewhat differently. At this time you will be presented the bill for your behavior during the last 28 to 29 years: your experiences will be different depending on whether you have been able to live in harmony with yourself or if you have been building on sand and have only been acting in your own interests.



In the worst case, you will recognize the mistakes which you have made in past and be forced to begin again from the start. As you are confronted with necessary changes, you may become aware that some of your conceptions about your role in society arent realistic and then be faced with the necessity of making changes. A ""Saturn Return"" will bring up important decisions concerning your future plans. You could make use of the opportunity to get rid of some old baggage, although you may complicate matters by not being able to let go. This can effect all areas of life concerning Saturns house position: marriage or partnership, friends, work, self image and everything else will be examined critically. Anything which doesnt meet the demands of the future will manifest itself as a crisis and will eventually be shaken off. Individuals or circumstances which survive this period will later play an important role in your life.



Still things dont have to become as dramatic as this sounds. If you can rationalize your actions to yourself and look at yourself in the mirror in good conscience, the effects of this transit should be more mild.

There is no reason for you to lose confidence, you demonstrate reliability in everything you do. Your employer has every reason to be satisfied.

Exaggerated self doubt, fear and neglect can hinder you from continuing on as you have. Maybe you are currently having nightmares or are subject to disillusioning experiences. And hopefully you will recognize that the goals you are following arent so desirable. If you are forced to reorient yourself, you will only meet up with hurdles.



Seen positively, this transit can bring about a time of inner transformation. As you part with unrealistic future dreams, begin to see clearly and take your life into your own hands, you can build a spiritual foundation, which wont be easily taken away from you. The plans you make will come out of your innermost being which are also realistic. At the end of this period of development you could adopt a new perspective, because you will have learned to pull yourself out of a crisis using nothing but your own strength and have held on to the dreams which are really worth holding on to."
2449;TRANSIT_0000000002113922;Transiting Saturn in Opposition with your Neptune;"This could be a time of inner instability, because you are uncertain about the direction your life should take and are unsure about which goals you should choose.

There is a danger that you will isolate yourself, keep others at a distance and eventually suffer from the loneliness. Withdrawing out of fear of being criticized or not being accepted will only drive you deeper in your misery. Self-pity could cause you to close your eyes to reality and reject every reasonable suggestion. This will tell if your subconscious hopes, wishes and fears bear a relation to reality and the inescapable necessities of life on this planet.



Most likely you wont be able to identify the external causes of your insecurity, because self doubt usually comes from within. Even if you feel overwhelmed, like everything is growing over your head, you shouldnt just give up. Instead try to find things to work on that are more appropriate to your abilities. Dont allow yourself to take on too much or to avoid obligations."

Serious considerations of inner processes may also include an objectified analysis based on the goals of creating some ""order"" in your spiritual life, discovering your spirituality without throwing your current way of life overboard, and achieving a deeper understanding of your hidden desires, hopes and fears.

At the moment you are preoccupied with death or the cycles which determine all aspects of life and death. Maybe you are afraid of living and are trying to hold onto people or circumstances although detachment would more likely lead you to a solution. During this time you will learn to accept certain truths. Also tranquillity will often get you further than the pressure people are forced to live with or place upon themselves willingly. Because outward successes may be long in coming, you will have to concentrate on inner values and examine yourself to find the cause of your lack of power. If you have tried to control everything or manipulate people, you will recognize that it doesnt help.



Maybe someone is trying to control you or has a plan to play you out against someone else; this will force you to fight back with tooth and nail.

There may also be pressure from outside to deal with, which you dont want to accept. This can lead to exaggerations and inappropriate reactions on your part adding to the confusion of the situation. Generally you are dissatisfied and want to make changes, but havent found the right way. In any case, you will have to take some restrictions into account, which may have financial consequences.



The best thing to do is to stay as calm as possible and maybe get some advice from a good friend. Dont let your concentration lapse because accidents could also make your life more difficult during this period. Compromises of your own wishes and plans will be inevitable because you wont have enough energy to make your greatest dreams come true."
2456;TRANSIT_0000000002408834;Transiting Saturn in Trine with your Pluto;"Under this transit you will notice an increase in your ability and willingness to achieve, as well as your motivation and clarity about which goals are worthwhile. If problems arise this is no reason to give up or even to lower your expectations. Patience, power and stamina will guarantee success. What is especially important is to think about your motivation and promote your ""inner development"". Instead of allowing yourself to become overconfident you will examine all the sides of your personality. Subconscious processes are positively influenced by outward successes. After all this a more realistic self assessment should sharpen your consciousness of the meaning of a united community."

2458;TRANSIT_0000000009191810;Transiting Saturn in Opposition with your Ascendant;"This constellation represents all kinds of problems with relationships. Possibly you will have to work on conflicts in your relationship which have been building up for a while. Maybe your partners expectations of you exceed your capacity or maybe you feel under pressure. Even strangers can cause problems, conspire against you or just have a hostile attitude toward you. Friendships may also be put to the test.



In spite of all this try to stay friendly and open because true friendships will last and will help you through this difficult time."
2459;TRANSIT_0000000009224578;Transiting Saturn in Trine with your Ascendant;Other people get the impression that you are determined, calm and collected. Maybe you arent as spontaneous as usual, but are showing more responsibility instead. People are more than ready to leave the organization of everything they undertake up to you because you dont take things lightly and make an effort to fulfill the expectations. It will become clear what it is you want from others and how you should structure your contacts. Maybe you have become dependent on a certain group of friends, therefore you should try to be more open for surprises and changes. It could be that reputation and responsibility are important to you such that you hide your weaknesses or dont lead the life you would really like to. If you dont restrict yourself more than absolutely necessary, you could build a stable foundation.
2460;TRANSIT_0000000009208194;Transiting Saturn in Square with your Ascendant;"During this period you make an inhibited or fearful impression, although there may not be a simple explanation for it. It could be difficult to overcome your inhibitions in order to enjoy relaxed, uncomplicated relations with others. It could be related to a work overload or may even bring it about, because you withdraw in order to make better use of the time. Maybe you have to come to terms with the fact that you have very few friends and will have to change your behavior if you dont want to become completely isolated. It is high time to take a closer look at what kind of impression you are making on people and to think about what kind of filters determine the superficial impressions others receive.



This period probably seems a lot more serious to you than it really is, so dont let yourself be intimidated. Try to stay friendly and open because true friendships will last and will help you get through difficult times."

2462;TRANSIT_0000000009175426;Transiting Saturn in Conjunction with your Ascendant;"Under this transit you wont come across as being especially relaxed and spirited. Maybe you start talking about obligations and achievements right when your friends want to have fun. Or you have to battle with an illness and are prevented from coming into contact with others. Something always keeps you from reaching beyond yourself and reacting to the current situation with flexibility. Just watch out that you dont become isolated from your friends, because you are showing them the cold shoulder, whether you are aware of it or not.



Although you are working hard and can accomplish a lot, the workload could overwhelm you; always take time for a pleasant change of pace. If you should ever need help overcome your pride and knock on the doors of strangers; you will certainly have an opportunity to repay the kindness."
2463;TRANSIT_0000000009503106;Transiting Saturn in Sextile with your MC;"During this time you will concentrate tirelessly on realizing your professional plans. Without expecting instant success you are prepared to invest in preparations. Having carefully selected your goals, you can count on achieving them. It is important to appear responsible and correct in the public view, although no one has any real reason to complain about you. Social responsibility is a very serious topic in your life, although this may sound conservative, it is an honest expression of your values.



One thing you cant stand is when people are constantly complaining but dont do anything to improve things. Maybe you are starting to reconsider the ideals of your youth and are getting an impression of how the rest of your life might look. At present you are taking things balanced and sober, but it may not stay that way for ever. In this period holding on to this kind of attitude could save you from great disappointments."
2464;TRANSIT_0000000009470338;Transiting Saturn in Square with your MC;"At this time some barriers could be placed on your way up the professional success ladder. Maybe these burdens are so great that you feel unable to do anything about it and are ready to throw in the towel. Overtime, a boss in a rotten mood or competition for promotions can be frustrating. Maybe you have the feeling that your achievements arent being recognized and could even be right about that. This wont be a time of great successes, so dont expect to see any rewards for your efforts just yet.



Accept restrictions, dont let it get so far that you neglect your private life and refuse to let yourself relax and enjoy life. If you havent taken your profession or your reputation serious in the past, you will now be forced to make some decisions which will give your social life new direction. Saturn has a balancing effect in the long term, and as unpleasant as the events may be, you will have to realize that you alone carry the responsibility for it."

2466;TRANSIT_0000000009453954;Transiting Saturn in Opposition with your MC;Because under this transit your professional life wont be bringing much success, you should direct your attention on your family and the affairs of the home. Here circumstances could prove to have a stabilizing effect although their expression may take a different form than you expect. Maybe you will finally decide to get married, build a house or renovate your apartment. In any case you know how you want to organize your own space and will go ahead and do it. Be careful not to lose your spontaneity and start conforming to the changing situations. There is also the danger that you appear cool and reserved to the people you care most about. Although you take family obligations serious, remember that the real attachment of the family is emotional, not organizational.
2467;TRANSIT_0000000009454018;Transiting Uranus in Opposition with your MC;"This period may bring great changes to your private affairs and family life. Maybe you are planning to move to remodel your house, are expecting an addition to the family or have a provocation of small children to deal with.



Whatever the case, you should stay open to new developments because you could use some intellectual stimulation. They may even help you to overcome inhibitions and out-dated taboos concerning they way you treat others and allow a feeling of community to be intensified and more closeness to develop. Be helpful if anyone around you should have problems. Quick reactions are called for, because if Uranus is around, flexibility will have to be demonstrated sooner or later. Let yourself get involved in personal relationships, if problems at work should develop, they can be better solved at another point in time."
2468;TRANSIT_0000000000016834;Transiting Uranus in Opposition with your Sun;"In this phase you will be challenged to stay flexible. The more rigid your habits and other behavior become, the more pressure you will be under to change your ways. Maybe too much is happening all at once and you have to agree that you can hardly plan anything or know what to expect.



It is possible that the drive for change comes from within you because you are bored and have the feeling that something has to happen. An intense inner turmoil is overtaking you and you wont be satisfied until old baggage has been discarded and you have your freedom.



Although you have an opportunity to achieve independence and to experience your individuality, the path will take you through some conflicts. So you should constantly examine your goals to make sure that they are appropriate and not just one of your whims which is causing other people to suffer. This transit will stimulate you to rethink the organization of your life and then hopefully only make the changes which are necessary."
2469;TRANSIT_0000000000049602;Transiting Uranus in Trine with your Sun;"During this phase you will primarily learn flexibility. If you think that life cant hold any more surprises for you, this transit will convince you otherwise.

Maybe you will make some new friends or maybe your friends will be a source of inspiration which will lead to an overhaul of your outlook on life. 



Probably you are pretty open to changes and could welcome an inner transformation which will make you sociable, open and receptive to impulses. Now you have the opportunity to defend yourself against senseless regulations without taking on the entire society or getting out of touch. Let your original and unorthodox sides show because your individual development will be the center of attention. Although it concerns your personal freedom, you dont intend to use this term to wreck havoc or to get ahead on the backs of others."

Admit that you wont get very far with your current habits and behavior because it is impossible to plan anything or to know what to expect. Maybe you are upset about it although it would be better to use the opportunity to finally get away from your every day rut. If you are open to changes you will be able to profit from them by initiating an inner transformation which will make you more open, sociable and more receptive to impulses. Expand your horizon and discover new opportunities by using the connections you have to interesting people. If you block your development or evade challenges, barriers will be placed in your way until it seems as though nothing will work and you are about to entirely lose your motivation.



Be aware that during this time you can get rid of old baggage and should do so; you have the potential to find new forms of self expression and only abide by the rules which you respect."
2473;TRANSIT_0000000000262594;Transiting Uranus in Conjunction with your Moon;"During this transit you will concentrate on the inconsistency of your own emotions such that you may find yourself reacting to your environment with moody indecisiveness or dissatisfaction. Sudden events may turn your emotional state upside down and you may notice emotions which were unknown to you before. Now you have more of a need for freedom than a feeling of security. Others want to restrict you or put you in chains leaving you disgruntled. Your basic attitude insists on being able to do everything that pops into your mind. Try not to overdo it in that respect or no one will be able to rely on you any more.



The goal is achieving emotional independence. At least from the standpoint of your basic attitude you arent willing to do what is expected of you. Maybe women will be more important to you during this transit, regardless of your gender. You feel attracted to women, who stand for individuality, independence and spirit. It should be easy for you to express your emotions, even if they arent of the positive variety. It would be wonderful if you could feel really alive and recognize that even traditional values change and nothing is so permanent. Now you have the opportunity to leave the past behind you and to see new opportunities due to your spontaneity."
2474;TRANSIT_0000000000328130;Transiting Uranus in Sextile with your Moon;"The lesson of this transit is to give your emotions free reign. Uranus, the unexpected element of the horoscope, makes sure that the entire range of emotions comes into play, and you should learn to accept their effects. Although your impressions will be more subjective, thanks to the harmonious nature of this transit, it shouldnt give you any trouble.



At the moment you have more of a need for freedom than for a feeling of security. You would prefer to respond from your gut and make your standpoints clear to your family. There may be cause to move in the near future, or you will just redecorate your home. Changes within the family, your home or in the relationship to your mother could arise. During this phase you are going to meet people who will help you with all of this. Women may be especially important in this transit regardless of your gender because you feel attracted to women, who stand for individuality, independence and spirit.

2475;TRANSIT_0000000000295362;Transiting Uranus in Square with your Moon;"As with all difficult transits, problems which have been suppressed in the past may surface during this Transit. There will probably be tension, dissatisfaction or struggles for independence in your emotional world, even if you arent able to identify its cause. Especially in your relationship to women you could have difficulties because you refuse to take on responsibility, allow no one to get close to you, or to offer emotional support to others. It may go so far that you want to break out and reorient yourself. Being impatient, you get frustrated very easily and are quick to feel torn and uprooted. Because the situation is difficult to judge at this point, you should put off important decisions until you have come to peace with yourself. Dont forget that your behavior will influence events on the surface which you will quickly suppress but these may also be in some way intended.



During this period you will have a deep need to express your individuality, recognize your value and not to submerge into the masses. That is all well and good, but you are not likely to achieve your goals if you affront your best friends and prove yourself to be irresponsible and fickle. Consider whether the problems which come about can be solved by a frank talk with your mother."

2478;TRANSIT_0000000000541122;Transiting Uranus in Opposition with your Mercury;"This transit is classically associated with confusion, nervousness and difficulties with concentration. That may be due to your openness allowing you to take in so many impressions that you arent able to find the time to sort them out. Although mentally you are running at top speed, you are still overworked. It would help to relax and spend some time getting your head together.



During this time you will be inclined to take on extreme positions and even believe that you have finally found the ultimate truth. Still you hold back when talking to your friends to avoid confusing them too much; it would be better to listen to someone you trust and let yourself be brought back down to Earth.



Maybe you have the feeling that your thoughts are getting out of control and are bringing you into areas where you dont want to be. Everything interests you although you cant let yourself be too deeply involved in any single topic, because you are too impatient since everything has to happen immediately. Avoid making important decisions at this time, because there is a danger that you will overlook important details and be mislead by wishful thinking. Even if you have great ideas for the future, your insights could merely confuse you making you appear inconsequent.

There may be an increase in your desire to communicate, which won't permit you to keep your opinions to yourself. Boredom will hardly come up during this transit because you will encounter new fields of learning. The physical sciences and Astrology may especially fascinate you. Uranus is associated with sudden changes whereas travel is attributed to Mercury, so there may be more activity in this respect during this transit. Although you may not undertake a trip around the world, but may be traveling for business reasons, which could prove to be stimulating.



One goal could be to get rid of your prejudices and approach new areas openly. Spiritual development will become more important and you dont let anyone dictate which direction it should take. The search for spiritual independence has very good chances of succeeding."

So much about the unpleasant effects of this transit. If Mercury's natal chart position is challenged you could be fighting against free thinking, this could cause confusion. It may be difficult to concentrate and in the end you may be unsure of your beliefs. As your options constantly change your environment also becomes unsettled.

People who seem independent and lead exciting lives will seem especially attractive. Maybe you will use a new lover to break out and leave your mundane life behind. Still you will probably dive into it opening yourself up to disappointments because you didnt take a close enough look to start with. Uranus likes to idealize, of course being in love makes it easier than at any other time. If you feel oppressed or bored in your old relations, this is the phase to reorient yourself. Maybe you will end your relationship overnight, although that will be extremely painful for your current partner. It would be possible to discover unexplored and exciting aspects in your previous relationship and experience something like a second honeymoon.



Generally you will experience changes in all your relationships. It will be easy for you to approach people openly and without prejudices. Also you think a lot about the community and mostly defend liberal issues.

People who are independent and lead exciting lives will seem especially attractive during this phase and will probably cross your path more often.



However, Venus doesnt only represent romance, but also social life, leisure and a sense of aesthetics. This may lead to an increased interest in the arts and music or you may find your way out into the public eye, maybe by means of new friends.



Maybe you will use a new lover to break out and leave your mundane life behind.

It may be your partner who brings up a separation, which will shock you because you refused to face the truth earlier. However when it comes about, there will be turmoil which will also have healing effects. Maybe you will begin to defend your rights and not let your partner put you under pressure.



On the other hand, you should watch out that you dont exaggerate and allow fear of intimacy to block all familiarity or become irrational and unpredictable. Maybe you will decide to surround yourself with people who you have absolutely nothing in common with just because you think it will demonstrate uniqueness. Although you are open to meeting new people, it is improbable that the relationships will be long lived. Boredom is not something you can take now, you will demand interesting entertainment.

2488;TRANSIT_0000000001065410;Transiting Uranus in Opposition with your Mars;"During this transit you will receive a sudden rush of energy, but will have difficulties using your strength appropriately. Possibly you feel provoked although no one wants to harm you, you fight off invisible enemies. Now your responses could be quick-tempered, impulsive or violent so it would be better if you would try to find something useful to invest your energy in. At the moment patience isnt one of your strong points, just be careful that you dont let your frustrations out on innocent bystanders. Try to get ahead step by step and to concentrate on what you are doing because you may be prone to accidents.



Also during this time you will try to call attention to yourself and prove your courage, independence and high energy levels. Pay attention to your tone of voice as well as other peoples feelings otherwise you may not earn much sympathy.



Before you go fighting for your rights, consider more carefully if they have really been infringed upon or if you can find a compromise. It could end up leaving you the victim of your own aggressions and even get you tangled up in physical conflicts. Take your time making decisions and avoid saying things that you might regret later.

Now you want to be autonomous in thought and action and will do everything in your power to get there, which may prove to be impressive during this transit. You should be able to put your potential to good use even if you start new projects which you cant bring to a positive end. Filter out the most important projects and concentrate on these. Be certain about the goals you want to achieve and dont hesitate to use unconventional methods to be successful. It is fun to use energy playfully and test your limits. Most likely you will meet up with others who share your convictions in the course of your endeavors, whose goal is to lead a free and independent life.



The planet Uranus is also associated with Astrology, if you have a basic interest in this field, this would be an appropriate time to continue your studies. Generally you could create opportunities to further develop your creative potential and also have a chance to let off steam. Because Mars represents the human sex drive, new developments of an erotic nature could provide impulses to an existing relationship. Possibly you will be able to unload some old inhibitions, complexes or prejudices which will also lead to a freer sexuality. New possibilities will arise since your libido has been activated and you are not averse to exciting romantic adventure."

2492;TRANSIT_0000000001049026;Transiting Uranus in Conjunction with your Mars;"This transit will bring a sudden rush of energy. It is all up to you whether you use this potential productively or waste it on nonsense. Maybe you feel wound up and start new projects, without managing to finish any of them because you lack the necessary power of concentration and stamina. No matter what goal you pursue, you can go about it in an unconventional way and still be successful. Deviating from old ways and seeking new challenges will help to advance your development.



Still, there is a danger that you will act rashly and give in to uncontrollable temper tantrums whenever your expectations dont hold up to reality and others expect you to admit that. During this phase you want to prove yourself and primarily work towards putting your ideals into practice. Although your striving for independence is great, you are often too impatient or ruthless in search of acceptance. Create an opportunity to develop your creativity and let off steam, that should have positive effects.



Mars stands for the human sex drive and can therefore bring about a new development in this area. Maybe you will be able to unload some of your old inhibitions, complexes or prejudices and open the way to a freer sexuality. Use your active libido to discover new possibilities since you have nothing against exciting romantic adventures."

That is exactly what you need now. There may be some interesting experiences in store for you, such as a long trip which may involve exciting adventures. Experiences like this can cause you to see the world with new eyes.



Still you could use this period concretely by devoting yourself to new fields of study and could certainly include Astrology, which supports the understanding of an individual's role on this planet. Because you wont allow yourself to be restricted, you will probably prefer to study on your own.



Generally, your present outlook on life is very idealistic and if you could, you would abolish all injustice on this planet. It is important for you to harmonize your interests with those of your community and to adjust your goals. Unexpected events and new acquaintances will help you on your way with positive impulses. Your optimism will ensure that the projects you initiate will be successful and will also guarantee that your efforts will be rewarded.



The nice thing about this transit is that you no longer have to defend yourself against coercion and restrictions of the past, they will disappear by themselves and make way for an expanded order in your life."
2494;TRANSIT_0000000001311170;Transiting Uranus in Conjunction with your Jupiter;"This transit will stimulate your need to expand your intellectual horizons and lead you to experiences which will allow you to see the world through different eyes. If you use this period productively, you will gain a new understanding of tolerance, benevolence and sincere loyalty.



Although your basic attitude towards life is idealistic, you are quite capable of facing reality, finding your way to positions of free thinking and then harmonizing your interests with those of your community. The way there will take you through unexpected events, which will mostly be positive experiences. Your optimism also ensures a positive outcome for the projects you initiate and guarantees a reward for your efforts.



Still you shouldnt allow yourself to become overconfident and place your home at risk; that might not have the outcome you were hoping for. This time is especially appropriate for a confrontation with new ideas. Because you probably dont want to impose restrictions on yourself, you may prefer to study on your own. Your contemplation on your life and your role in society could have a significance beyond this transit. Just dont let yourself be conned into opposing every kind of institution or coercion, because that wont get you very far."

In breaking out of the daily rut and taking advantage of opportunities you dont always take things seriously enough and can be overwhelmed by the course of events. Responsible planning could have brought about more sensible results. Pay attention, observe the developments closely and stay flexible.



Change is called for, but you arent sure where it should lead to. Although you would like to be rid of restrictions and coercion, experiences show that its not possible without great sacrifice. Also you need the community, even if it is tied to obligations. A search for great intellectual freedom can lead to extremist positions, which wont help you in the long run, although they may contain some significant and justified points. There is a danger of finding yourself in the midst of an adventure, whose outcome cant yet be fathomed.

Your struggles to free yourself from restrictions and obligations will be accompanied by an increase in pressure. Maybe you complain about having to work too hard and have obligations which you arent able to meet. Under this transit you will be tested to find out how much you can handle before youre tempted to give up entirely. There may be problems with authorities because your drive for freedom will no longer allow to follow orders or commands.



Maybe the effects of this transit will express themselves in the opposite direction, as trusted structures are destroyed through unforeseen events and deep feelings of insecurity leave you unable to take advantage of the freedom you have attained. By and large it comes down to how flexible you are and your ability to adjust to the latest developments.



If you refuse to rid your life of unnecessary baggage and face changes, Uranus may force you into it. That may be painful at first, but it will bring with it opportunities for a new beginning."
2499;TRANSIT_0000000001622466;Transiting Uranus in Trine with your Saturn;"In this period of your life you will have the opportunity to make structural changes, leave senseless fears behind you and adopt a more pleasant attitude toward the future.

An understanding for the restrictions which have left their mark on your life will give you the courage to stand up for your freedom.



Because this transit is completely harmonious, you will receive the opportunity to gather strength, to discover and to reach a new self image. Take advantage of it, reach for your ideals and rid yourself of unnecessary restrictions, but remember that you are also capable of losing sight of your own responsibilities. This will lead you to a new freedom and bring a breath of fresh air into your life, without causing you to give up necessary structures.

The changes you will experience will require you to react with flexibility and not to respond from your gut. Your old ways are no longer reliable and you now have been given the opportunity to discover new strengths and to develop a new understanding of yourself. This depends on whether you recognize opportunities or merely lament about your plight and complain about imagined disadvantages. It would be possible to live out your ideals and shake off constraints and compulsion, just dont reject all responsibility and arouse insecurity in even your best friends by acting like a mutineer. Uranus and Saturns opposing qualities should be kept in balance. If you can manage that you will create free space and bring a fresh wind into your life without having to give up essential structures. It may be that overnight you will recognize that striving for a career and social recognition is pointless and suddenly drop out.



In any case you will have to consider what you want out of life and eventually make radical decisions quickly. Under some circumstances you may continue on as before, but your new attitude has added a deeper meaning to your goals allowing you to accept values such as discipline and order. If you have allowed your father to put you under pressure up until now, you will at present be able to develop independently of his expectations. A direct talk with him could help a lot."
2503;TRANSIT_0000000001835458;Transiting Uranus in Conjunction with your Uranus;This transit occurs shortly after birth when the transiting Uranus is retroactive and crosses the position of Uranus in your birth chart again, or about at the age of 85 years, which can be seen as the end of a Uranus cycle. As a baby or a small child one experiences a time of constant turmoil due to the constant confrontation with various impressions which can be exhausting. If you are of an advanced age, you will be able to withdraw from all obligations and look back on life somewhat objectively. It is a time to prepare for death and to give up your desire for individuality.
2504;TRANSIT_0000000001900994;Transiting Uranus in Sextile with your Uranus;"This transit comes along twice in each persons lifetime: once during puberty and once at about 70 years of age during retirement. Our understanding of Uranus transit is therefore more like a cycle which should be seen in its entirety.



If the sextile comes about for the first time early on in life, this is similar to suddenly becoming an adult, at least physically. Interest in the opposite sex will be aroused and often you can observe how young people rebel against their parents in this and insist on being able to lead their own lives. Activities which are beyond the scope of the family will become more important, because that is where sudden developments and experiences take place which are so essential to the individual development.



The second sextile transit comes around during retirement and will hopefully inspire you to become active again in your old age, although that may be difficult because older people often arent sure what they should do with their freedom, once they have it. So this transit can symbolize the loss of professional structures, which have determined the lives of people for more than 40 years. Try to use this opportunity to take on projects which you have been wanting to work on all your life and have been putting off. Dont think that its too late now."
2505;TRANSIT_0000000001868226;Transiting Uranus in Square with your Uranus;"This transit comes about twice in the life of the average person: once during the early twenties and later, in the early sixties, shortly before retirement. This is why people refer to Uranus transits as a cycle seen in its entirety from the perspective of the individual.



The first time this transit comes up, it symbolizes the difficulty of entering adulthood. More and more it is expected that you rely on yourself in your decision making and that you ward off everything that has hindered you in your development. If young people are leaving their parents homes early, this period could be a time of detachment from ones parents. Individual responsibility for your own actions and forming an independent identity is what is called for. People want a new orientation although our system of values is being constantly revised.



As this constellation appears the second time we find ourselves in preparation for retirement and again it is a time of letting go from something which a lot of people at this age dont enjoy leaving; the workplace. It makes it seem like youre being thrown onto the scrap heap, although no one finds it easy to deal with getting older. Unfortunately in our Western society it has become commonplace for older people to be put out to pasture, whereas other cultures continue to profit from their wisdom."
2506;TRANSIT_0000000001884610;Transiting Uranus in Trine with your Uranus;"Usually everyone experiences this constellation twice: the first time at around 28 years of age, and the second time at about 56. In the context of the Uranus cycle, this transit is generally seen positively.



During the first Uranus-Uranus Trine the so-called Saturn Return occurs simultaneously, which is of great significance to the individual as its effects coincide with this transit. This is the phase for reflection on ones experiences and there is also time to consider their meaning with relative objectivity. At this time necessary corrections will be made such as a divorce and changing jobs. After having gotten some life experience, but still young enough to start over completely with a new orientation if need be. Maybe you doubt whether the direction you have been going is right for you, but it is necessary to find the courage to make decisions.



At the age of 56 you should have learned to overcome unnecessary inhibitions and fears and to accept your personality. You should take the liberty which is your right and not let yourself be put under pressure without good reason. Maybe to your own amazement you will start over again and explore new paths which may lead to unusual experiences. Certainly there is no danger of becoming reckless because you have had time to find out what is really important to you."
2507;TRANSIT_0000000001851842;Transiting Uranus in Opposition with your Uranus;"The Uranus-Uranus opposition is the most important transit of the Uranus cycle and is every bit as significant as the so-called Saturn Return. This transit occurs between the ages of 39 and 44 years, the period psychologists refer to as the mid life crisis. This term addresses frustrations associated with unfulfilled dreams and relationships which over the years have become empty. When a person suddenly notices that there isnt unlimited time to devote to achieving goals or to get to know oneself and others better.



Naturally it depends on whether the individual has been making its own way and is responsible for all of its actions. Generally this transit will provoke a panicky reaction and hurried decisions whereby you burn bridges behind you and then regret it shortly thereafter. Take time to consider which aspects of your life should really be changed and which are worth keeping. Create perspectives for the future because you wont be able to change the past."
2508;TRANSIT_0000000002113986;Transiting Uranus in Opposition with your Neptune;"In this phase you could sense sudden impulses of unusual longings which may blow you away. Maybe its important for you to use your abilities in service to your community or you want to have collective sensations and spiritual experiences. Unfortunately you take things too emotionally, are naive and expect a great wave to carry you away from it all and give you the opportunity to forget reality and explore other worlds. There is a danger that you suppress reality and escape into your ideals, this tendency may be further complicated by an increase in drug consumption.



Give yourself a break during this transit, because you wont be especially productive anyway. If you feel like youre losing the ground from under your feet, then confide in a good friend, it would be especially advantageous to talk to someone older who has already been through it all. In any case avoid taking steps which bar the way back."

Even in spiritual or intellectual matters you could make positive experiences which could awaken an interest for the esoteric. Astrology is one area which is free of examinations and curricula, and may be just what you have been looking for. Learning a little about cosmic justice never hurt anyone and has helped many to a better understanding of their own existence.



If you should feel inspired to become creative, this transit will be especially appropriate because it stimulates your latent artistic talents. Thanks to your sensitive antennae, you can do a lot to help victims of discrimination, especially because feelings of sympathy will be especially active during this period.

Maybe it will be difficult for you to concentrate on your work or to bring your thoughts to a logical conclusion. Even in your emotional world you are subject to strong mood changes and ideals play an important role. Incomprehensible dreams can contribute to your tendency to escape or to ponder idle questions. On a physical level, this transit could manifest itself in the form of immune deficiencies or constant fatigue. Maybe you feel weak and are experiencing an unusual state of consciousness. It is difficult for you to aim for concrete goals or to make decisions. Its as if you werent living entirely in this world, although this may guide you to unusual spiritual experiences.



There is a danger of relying more on drugs or searching for wholeness in religious groups, following bogus gurus. In a positive sense, you could be inspired to write down your thoughts, compose music or place yourself at the service of your community. Your antennae are so sensitive that the signals you receive could lead you to jump to conclusions."

Generally, deep reaching developments could be set in motion which will influence the rest of your life.

Somehow you will free yourself from a lot of obligations whose restrictive effects on your life will become clear during this transit.

2518;TRANSIT_0000000009191874;Transiting Uranus in Opposition with your Ascendant;"Even if people tend to notice your uniqueness, you have to be prepared for reactions which arent so positive. Unforeseen events involving others could create a lot of commotion in your life. This could be a separation in one form or another, or you may radically change your appearance and come up with some other surprises.



Consistency isnt exactly one of your strong points, and you may cause sudden changes in the lives of other people as well as confusion. Probably you are more surprised than anyone about what is happening to you, because you are no longer able to guess what old friends are likely to do.



All human relationships are unpredictable at the moment, unfortunately this could have negative consequences, therefore be careful and dont be too quick to trust people you just met."
2519;TRANSIT_0000000009224642;Transiting Uranus in Trine with your Ascendant;"This transit will require you to do things together with other people who will appreciate your openness and spontaneity. At the moment you are quite charming, even if you are a little odd at times, because you enjoy showing the unconventional side of yourself. If you intend to take advantage of a certain freedom or get away from restricting circumstances, you will receive the necessary support. Some of the people you meet will have lived through all of this and will therefore make an impression on you.



It would be a good time to get to know people. Being open, liberal and tolerant you should make sure that you express your limitations clearly and that your convictions remain unshakable. Be prepared for surprises because you will attract them during this period. This transit may bring many new impulses to your life and it is up to you to use them wisely."

2522;TRANSIT_0000000009175490;Transiting Uranus in Conjunction with your Ascendant;People notice your unconventional ways and appreciate the way you go about making friends. Group activities always go over well, so it wont often come that you are left sitting at home alone. Possibly you will radically change your appearance and are good for many surprises. Consistency isnt exactly one of your strong points, but no one holds it against you because you tend to be entertaining and have a contagious good mood. Sometimes you can even bring about sudden changes in other peoples lives and cause a lot of confusion. Because your intentions are usually good, this should have a positive effect on your character. Just dont make the mistake of getting caught up in things and making decisions too quickly, which wont be so easy to reverse later.
2523;TRANSIT_0000000009437634;Transiting Uranus in Conjunction with your MC;"During this time you should be open for changes to your professional life. Probably you have trouble showing respect to authorities or putting in overtime, therefore you should keep your rebellious tendencies in check, that is if you are interested in keeping your job. Maybe you will think about going into business for yourself. This will save you from being responsible for fulfilling others expectations. Still you should avoid making decisions too quickly because establishing a source of income takes a lot of planning.



As you worry about your career, you have a lot of interesting ideas, unfortunately you are not inclined to perform physical labor. Dont let yourself get a reputation for being unreliable and lazy at the cost of your co-workers. If you get bored and want to do something about tedious routine work, remember that this transit wont last for ever. On the other hand, a lot of possibilities could open up but it is up to you to use them wisely."
2524;TRANSIT_0000000009503170;Transiting Uranus in Sextile with your MC;"During this time sudden changes to your profession could arise. Try to stay flexible and open to these changes. Possibly you will be promoted; dont rule out moving away to take on a better position. There may even be an influential person nearby who is willing to help you. Finally, this development will serve to increase your  freedom.



If you have been toying with the idea of going into business for yourself and freeing yourself of responsibility to someone else, there may be new opportunities, and it will be up to you to use them wisely. It is important that you initiate new developments and expect to harvest their fruits soon."
2525;TRANSIT_0000000009470402;Transiting Uranus in Square with your MC;"At this time an unexpected development at work may cause problems for you. External circumstances may prevent you from fulfilling your obligations, machines may break down or an essential colleague could call in sick. In the most extreme case you could lose your job and respond to your newly acquired freedom with more shock than joy.



Maybe you are responsible for all the excitement because the tedious routine work bores you. At this point you could lose interest in following the orders of a bad-tempered boss and get fed up too quickly. Be careful because during this phase you will be inclined to be impulsive and it may get you into trouble. Additionally, you may insist on calling attention to yourself and proving your uniqueness, which isnt likely to win you many friends. It would be better to keep yourself in check and be aware that this transit wont last as long as the memories of your outbursts."

Experiences from every area of life may confuse you so much that you are constantly rethinking your goals and making decisions which you change within a short time, because you talked yourself into believing something contrary to your intuition and your feelings. Although it would be advisable to avoid important decisions, that wont be possible throughout the entire duration of this transit, but at least try to leave a back door open for yourself.



Possibly you will be deceived due to your own naivet. Wanting to see only the good in other people, you wait until your experiences force you to learn more before you alter your perception of the world. There is also the danger that confusion or fear of the outside world will cause you to flee to a community where you seek comfort and end up allowing yourself to be exploited. A tendency to suppress the most basic truths may be your undoing. Withdrawing to wallow in self-pity wont get you anywhere.

Its as if you have stretched out your antennae and can receive signals which can be put to positive use. You are not only concerned with yourself but place your life experiences and energy at the service of others. Free from fear of tenderness and affection, you can express yourself artistically as your fantasy spurs you on and gives you confidence. Without losing your grip on reality, open yourself to your own inner world where you can make wonderful discoveries. It should be no problem to tell others about your joy and contentment so that people you love can profit from your insights. Express yourself by drawing or composing poetry.

Maybe you will get involved in a project which immediately turns out to be a flop. Rational judgment will be weakened, clear thoughts will be the exception but if youre lucky, intuition and sensitivity will make up for it.



Under this transit the powers of the ego will be dissolved and the need to be part of a greater whole can be felt more clearly. Maybe you will want to live in a community of people who share your beliefs and want to feel connected to ideas which can guide you to your rightful place in the universe. Just be careful not to fall into the hands of charlatans or bogus gurus.



Probably you are very willing to help others, especially since you are doing yourself a favor by letting altruism serve as your orientation. At the moment you need a lot of sleep and should give your body the rest it needs. Your vitality is not at its best; you may feel tired and be less productive than usual. Dont make the mistake of believing that other people understand you without exchanging a lot of words. Right now it is especially important to express your feelings and to talk about fears, self doubts and loneliness. If you express yourself clearly, you will find others who know exactly how you feel. Use this transit to discover your intuition and creative energy."
2532;TRANSIT_0000000000262658;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Moon;"In classical Astrology this transit stands for a time of emotional instability. It will be difficult for you to trust your own feelings. Ask yourself over and over again why it is that you love someone, what kind of security you need and why you react the way you do. During this phase you will be unusually sensitive or even oversensitive. Possibly you are preoccupied with the past, although, on the other hand, you could track down your childhood problems which may lead to an important development. But that will be the case only if you are ready to recognize unpleasant truths.



A tendency to be overcome by emotions compels you to leave the organization of your life to others. That cant work out and if you decide to withdraw out of disappointment or abused trust and vow to never again let anyone near you, you will be making one more mistake. Look for the cause of failed relationships in yourself. It may be that you expect to find heaven on Earth without having to confront another persons views.



If you experience this transit as a mature person, rich in life experience, you could get to know many new aspects of your emotional world and let yourself be guided by your inner voice."
2533;TRANSIT_0000000000328194;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Moon;"In this period you are very sensitive, but you should be careful not to let the signals you receive undermine your confidence. Expanding or intensifying your emotions wont necessarily throw your life out of joint. Emotionally your fantasy will find a positive echo, which will lift your spirits and leave you receptive to subtle energies from other people. This quality will protect you from deception. Especially women can leave long lasting impressions on you, still you shouldnt idealize them or put them on a pedestal. Probably you feel deeply connected to your mother or even dream about her. If there is any aspect about your relationship which should be cleared up, dont hesitate to tackle it. Now you wont insist on having your way, but are now ready to see things, even situations in which you were hurt, in a new light.



Generally, you treat others lovingly and try to allow closeness to develop. Intuitively you know that no one can expect more than they give and you arent afraid of giving too much and being disappointed. This emotional attitude may lead to many pleasant experiences."
2534;TRANSIT_0000000000295426;Transiting Neptune in Square with your Moon;"This transit denotes an extreme subjectivity, which is dangerous because you are apt to deceive yourself. Reacting emotionally and inconsistently gets you into complicated situations. According to the motto: ""If it isn't possible  it isnt"", you close your eyes to reality especially when it comes to dealing with people. Many disappointing events could be avoided by admitting your mistakes and taking shortcomings into account from the start. During this time you could suffer from such a lack of confidence that you dont even trust your own feelings, which may leave you feeling completely insecure. With your internal base setup, you may seek consolation within a larger community or make yourself a martyr. A pronounced willingness to suffer may leave you feeling weak and in need of protection.



The problem is that you dont know if your ideas about love and security are justified or completely exaggerated. Also your moods are enough to affront even your best friends. In this difficult time, dont lose your head, but make as much use of it as you can. Dont expect other people to make decisions for you, but you could ask their advice and try to see things from another perspective. Avoid drugs at all cost; they will neither help you nor broaden your vision."

2537;TRANSIT_0000000000541186;Transiting Neptune in Opposition with your Mercury;"This transit can inhibit a clear understanding and cause confusion in the area of communication. Perhaps you dont express yourself clearly and have trouble understanding where the person you are talking to is headed. It may be difficult to analyze and organize your thoughts or you wont be sure what you should make of all this. You may be taken in by deception and place your trust in people who have done nothing to earn it. You could also adopt other peoples opinions uncritically and dont realize your mistakes until later.



Be careful not to let yourself be talked into doing things you would normally oppose. The problem is that under this transit your intuition will also be effected and you could distrust both your intellect and your feelings. Making decisions will be especially difficult because you wont be able to assess the consequences. The time span of this transit will make it impossible to postpone all decisions. However, it would be better to rely on the advice of trusted friends, who are important to you and who you have known for a long time. Although it could be hard for you to talk about uncertainties, that is exactly what you should do. Dont waste your time day dreaming, but direct your thoughts to every day reality. Abstract and complicated topics could just add unnecessary frustration."
2538;TRANSIT_0000000000573954;Transiting Neptune in Trine with your Mercury;"During this transit you will get a lot of enjoyment out of your imagination. If you are able to find the right words to clothe your thoughts, it will be especially rewarding to make them accessible to other people. Without wanting to place unnecessary restrictions on the workings of your mind, try to examine the processes with which you solve every day problems. It may be that your way of thinking will change enough under the influence of this transit, making you conscious of new aspects of community. It would do you good to capture your momentary feeling of inspiration and freedom in poetic or literary works. Situations which seem mundane could now appear in a new light because you react more sensitively to what people want to tell you. Instead of remaining on the surface, you make an effort to sense which direction the conversation is taking and determine what kind of help would be most appreciated. Being open to metaphysical phenomena and mysticism as a part of daily life doesnt get to the point of being a danger to a healthy rationale or allow you to get lost in lofty ideals.



Attaining a deeper understanding of both yourself and the people you feel closest to will allow you to profit from a harmonious synthesis of intellect and sensitivity. Talk about ideas, visions, dreams and thoughts will result in a more productive exchange."

Make more of an effort to use language which is common and easily understood and also be sure to listen attentively to others. Probably some words have special meanings for you and misunderstandings can arise due to differing definitions. Another deficit of this transit is organizational skills. Important details may be overlooked, you may proceed carelessly or forget appointments. Even thinking one thought through to its conclusion may be difficult for you, you may also have trouble applying logic and drawing consequences.



In spite of all this, you will be delighted with your imagination. If you can manage to differentiate between your inner and outer reality, you may be able to compose poems or become active in other literary forms. Being open for spirituality and metaphysical phenomena, your intuition should function well. Just dont forget your daily obligations and try to take a look at your thought processes from a distance. Most likely you will be happy to share your innermost experiences with the people you feel close to. During this period of your life you will be prone to make decisions from the gut, depending on how you are feeling at the time."
2542;TRANSIT_0000000000786946;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Venus;"This transit is made up of two sides; one wonderful and one dangerous. To tell the bad news first: in your love life great confusion could arise because you are constantly falling in love with unattainable ideals. Once you are convinced to have found the great love of your life, you will discover tiny, ugly imperfections and be completely devastated. Disappointments like these are unavoidable. Maybe you believe that a fairy tale romance involves giving up ""The Self"" entirely and remain blind to whether your partner is willing to sacrifice or not. You are inclined to let yourself be exploited because you dont want to awaken out of your dreamy state.



If you were to find a way to avoid these dangers, it will open the way for some wonderful experiences. Willing to give everything, hopefully you will find someone who knows how to appreciate this quality. Probably you will rediscover your romantic vein and sometimes feel like youre living in a paradise.



If you havent put your extraordinary creativity to use up until now, this would be a good time to make your first attempt. During this phase your entire being will be softer and you will worry more about others and use your talents to create harmony.



Without wasting a lot of words you are able to express your needs and also harmonize them with those of your community. Especially sensitive people will be captivated by your charm and want to be your friends."
2543;TRANSIT_0000000000852482;Transiting Neptune in Sextile with your Venus;"During this time you may discover your romantic vein, if you havent already done so. You are sensitive, open to the needs of your partner and you know intuitively what is going on inside him or her. Without fear of being hurt you can give yourself, earn the trust of others and experience wonderful hours. With imagination and fantasy you are able to surprise your lover with small gifts or provide relaxing and fulfilling experiences for both of you.



Now you may get a little lazy and want to sit back and enjoy life. Under this transit, no one is interested in tackling every day problems or performing tedious tasks. It may be possible for you to just not see unpleasant truths, but you will have to take Mercurys position in your birth chart as well as its transits into consideration. Also in the arts great successes could provide confirmation because you are inspired and dont want to hide your feelings. Maybe you will surprise yourself with your creativity and the reception your work evokes. With your entire being you can spread an atmosphere of harmony and friendliness.

2544;TRANSIT_0000000000819714;Transiting Neptune in Square with your Venus;"Exaggerated ideals about love and friendship make your expectations unrealistic. Dreaming about happiness, harmony and belonging distracts you from dealing with daily problems. You could fall in love with someone who doesn't live up to your expectations and there is no chance of a relationship developing. Drowning in emotions, you are prepared to suffer a martyrdom. Dont be surprised if one day your friends refuse to listen to you or to give advice that you wont follow anyway. This transit will stimulate both your fantasy and your faith; unfortunately there is a danger of it leading to massive problems. You cant recognize what kind of affection is expected of you and what your own needs are. Neptune veils our perception of the qualities of the people around us, which increases vulnerability to disappointment and deceit. Try to be as honest as you possibly can and avoid developing exaggerated expectations. Possibly you are convinced of your ability to help people who have trouble coming to terms with their lives to find salvation and lead them to the right track.

2547;TRANSIT_0000000001065474;Transiting Neptune in Opposition with your Mars;Under this transit you could find yourself fighting an invisible enemy and want to defend yourself even if you havent been attacked. Feeling weakened and a fear of appearing egotistical prevents you from directing your energies toward a concrete goal. Being oversensitive and inclined to overreact could cost you some friendships. Problems are not only caused by ineffectively organizing work and your tendency to take on too much at once, but also by your lack of self-confidence. Maybe you no longer feel strong enough to fulfill your obligations. Although that isnt necessary yet because this transit is designed for contemplation on its motives and its behavior during competition. Dont rush into anything, even if a lack of courage should cause you to throw caution to the wind, there will be time enough to examine the effects within you. Mismanaged energy could lead to self inflicted psychological wounds, nightmares or violent fantasies. The most important thing during this period is not to put yourself under pressure or let your frustration out on innocent people.
2548;TRANSIT_0000000001098242;Transiting Neptune in Trine with your Mars;"In this period you will prefer to invest your energies in the well-being of other people. The ability to work well with others and leaving your personal goals in the background will be helpful in achieving harmony in accord with your humanitarian ideals. On the other hand your power of ego will prevent you from being exploited while you take on practical goals. Under this transit the goals you have set may be realized because during this time you wont rush into things but will be guided by inspiration. It could be of great help to show others how to work for the community without denying or neglecting their own individuality.



Keeping a good balance between your actions and energies will make you feel more at ease, especially if you work in a profession involving imagination, inspiration and vision. Possibly getting involved in competition or some other tense situation will alter your behavior toward people you dont like. During disagreements you try to really understand other people and respect their arguments always trying to draw useful consequences. This is only possible when disagreements are founded on every opinion being respected as a part of the whole. Especially during this time, you should be able to identify yourself with everyday tasks. If you are forced to do something against your convictions or something just doesnt feel right, it probably wont be successful now. It would be a shame for a wonderful potential to be lost due to this kind of constellation."
2549;TRANSIT_0000000001081858;Transiting Neptune in Square with your Mars;Under this transit you could find yourself fighting an invisible enemy and want to defend yourself even if you havent been attacked. Feeling weakened and a fear of appearing egotistical prevents you from directing your energies toward a concrete goal. Being oversensitive and inclined to overreact could cost you some friendships. Problems are not only caused by ineffectively organizing work and your tendency to take on too much at once, but also by your lack of self-confidence. Maybe you no longer feel strong enough to fulfill your obligations. Although that isnt necessary yet because this transit is designed for contemplation on its motives and its behavior during competition. Dont rush into anything, even if a lack of courage should cause you to throw caution to the wind, there will be time enough to examine the effects within you. Mismanaged energy could lead to self inflicted psychological wounds, nightmares or violent fantasies. The most important thing during this period is not to put yourself under pressure or let your frustration out on innocent people.
2550;TRANSIT_0000000001114626;Transiting Neptune in Sextile with your Mars;"In this period you will prefer to invest your energies in the well-being of other people. The ability to work well with others and leaving your personal goals in the background will be helpful in achieving harmony in accord with your humanitarian ideals. On the other hand your power of ego will prevent you from being exploited while you take on practical goals. Under this transit the goals you have set may be realized because during this time you wont rush into things but will be guided by inspiration. It could be of great help to show others how to work for the community without denying or neglecting their own individuality.



Keeping a good balance between your actions and energies will make you feel more at ease, especially if you work in a profession involving imagination, inspiration and vision. Possibly getting involved in competition or some other tense situation will alter your behavior toward people you dont like. During disagreements you try to really understand other people and respect their arguments always trying to draw useful consequences. This is only possible when disagreements are founded on every opinion being respected as a part of the whole. Especially during this time, you should be able to identify yourself with everyday tasks.

It would be a shame for a wonderful potential to be lost due to this kind of constellation."
2551;TRANSIT_0000000001049090;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Mars;"Neptunes energy is incompatible with Mars qualities, therefore you may feel weakened at this time. Maybe you want to invest more in the process of choosing goals, but feel guilty toward your community. The elbow mentality at work is so unbearable that you are considering reorienting yourself and using your energy for society.



If you neglect to consider the consequences of your actions or direct your energy toward a few projects, it could create problems for you. It would be better to concentrate, but dont let yourself be put under pressure. Looking within yourself and contemplating what it is you want to support and why, will help you to restore your energy and determination. Mars also represents sexuality and it can therefore come to changes in this respect. Transcending the limitations of your sexual fantasies will give you the opportunity to overcome inhibitions and fears. Possibly your interest in sex will decrease because Neptunes emphasis is more intellectual than physical. Anything motivated by egotistical interests which works against peaceful coexistence wont have much success in this period of time, at the very least they will leave a stale aftertaste. The challenge is to show as much concern for others as you do for yourself."
2552;TRANSIT_0000000001311234;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Jupiter;"If you have been living in accord with a code of ethics up until now, you may start to slip up. There may be a long period of time in which you are no longer sure what you should make of some of your experiences, although this can only lead to an evaluation of your ethical standards. Rigorous or restricting moral standards may dissolve and may even make way for altruism. If you get involved in any form of community service then do it with joy without adopting the role of a martyr. The feeling of being connected to the entire world allows you to keep up a good mood throughout the day and act according to your ideals. Possibly you are so deeply involved that the thought of not succeeding is incomprehensible. Be careful of exaggerated optimism!

Also reexamine whether you have overestimated your role in the course of events. Its better to take small steps which allow you to find fulfillment in every day life."
2553;TRANSIT_0000000001376770;Transiting Neptune in Sextile with your Jupiter;Now you feel comfortable with friends and acquaintances. Being open and friendly often leads to deeper discussions and an exchange of opinions. Probably you will have a feel for other peoples underlying outlook during this transit. That will help you avoid larger disappointments. Knowing what to expect from others enables you to avoid building up expectations and emphasizing negative character traits. The search for peace and harmony will bring you to spend more time in contemplation. A willingness to do something for the community may contribute to loosening up your strict moral code. Humanitarian thoughts may also be passed on to others who show an increased interest in listening to you. It is important to you to use your time wisely and to educate yourself. Your intuition may lead you to philosophical or religious subjects and you should be able to make use of your head and your instinct to give your life a new orientation. Appreciate your wonderful, calm and optimistic approach.
2554;TRANSIT_0000000001344002;Transiting Neptune in Square with your Jupiter;During this period it will be difficult for you to accurately estimate your own capacity and your role in the course of events. If you get on everyones nerves by dictating rules or preaching morals, it wont contribute to your popularity. Possibly your experiences will serve to confuse your outlook on the world such that you completely lose your sense of security and are no longer sure what is going on. That will only happen if your grand illusions caused you to see the world through rose colored glasses. Neptune could prevent you from seeing opportunities and allow your fortune to slip through your fingers. This could undermine your self confidence and cause you to see the developments more negatively than they actually are. Dont let it get you down, and try to lower your expectations a little. Both your expectations of yourself and on society are too high. Dont let your idealism bar you from every enjoyment because it seems insignificant. Even if you dont want to spend a lot of time worrying about the little things of every day life, you could at least take better care of your finances and keep an eye on your bank account.

Maybe it is nothing more than an inner process which other people wont even notice. As you begin to question your ambitions although you wont be able to give clear answers, because Neptune tends to create confusion. If you get a hold on your life and you dont have any difficulties smiling at your reflection, you could be fighting problems which dont actually exist; you are simply insecure if you continue as you have been without initiating any changes because the problems will dissolve into thin air.



Possibly you feel like you have built your life on sand and may be right. Old fears, inhibitions and also weighty responsibilities will drive away your enjoyment of life and make you uneasy. Probably you wont see any sensible alternative during this transit, because you are being deceived. It would be better to postpone decisions until a later point in time.

2558;TRANSIT_0000000001622530;Transiting Neptune in Trine with your Saturn;"Under this harmonious transit you will need to find a deeper significance in your work, accepting only the rules and structures which you can defend completely. Using your imagination and sensitivity at work will earn you a lot of encouragement from others. Without putting yourself under pressure unnecessarily, you do everything you can without getting upset. While staying focused on reality, you remain true to your ideals and your vision. During this period you will recognize what the essence of your being requires and what needs you would most like to fulfill. Probably you will appear more humble than usual because the outward signs of power wont mean as much to you as inner strength. Realizing your dreams will necessarily involve progress with concentration and stamina. It doesnt matter to you if the fruits of your efforts cant be harvested right away or if other people profit from your labor.

2561;TRANSIT_0000000001573378;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Saturn;"Under this transit you will experience how the structures of your life have reached a state of saturation and therefore, under the right circumstances, may dissolve completely. This would give you the opportunity to start all over again and improve your attitude toward life. If things go well you could be freed from old fears and inhibitions which will cause you to see your responsibility to society in a new light. This would also be the end of a development which is a great concern of yours in this period of your life. Before your new self confidence leads you to live independently, you will miss having things the way you are used to and will feel insecure. If you have been serious and responsible, you will now feel unusual needs, which you probably wont feel comfortable allowing yourself to fulfill. Thinking about work is not the focal point, but the subtle order of your internal life. Its up to you whether you avoid your responsibilities unable to keep yourself under control, or if you manage to get over your addiction to work in favor of intellectual development which will give your imagination more space. Especially your relationship to your father could improve during this transit. You are no longer willing to let yourself be pushed around, let others tell you what to do nor are you prepared to accept restrictions. Because you have the necessary sensitivity, you will have rough confrontations with your ""Old Man""."
2562;TRANSIT_0000000001835522;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Uranus;While youre living through this transit, remember that you arent alone, but are in the company of everyone your age. It is essential to consider the house position of Uranus in your birth chart as well as its aspects in the interpretation. Generally Neptune will slow Uranus down a little, not letting the changes come as suddenly as they otherwise would. In this period you should be able to avoid sudden actions or decisions, if only because Neptunes energy is basically confusing and you may not know which direction you should take. If you undertake something suddenly, it is likely to have negative consequences because self-deception or external disappointments may play a role. At the end of the century this transit will have influence on very old people. Maybe you are experiencing your own process of giving up your individuality in favor of reflection on human dreams, fantasies and visions as a need arises to withdraw from the outside world.
2563;TRANSIT_0000000001901058;Transiting Neptune in Sextile with your Uranus;"This is the time for spiritual insights. With your mind open to new experiences, you can feel free to start learning about any new topic. It would be especially helpful to approach Astrology or other fields of esoteric learning with intuition. While experimenting in every field, you accept limits and make sure that you keep your psychological stability. The most important thing is to expand your inner world and attain brotherhood and sisterhood with all of mankind. With generous offers of help and plenty of ideas you try to improve the conditions around you, whereas your concerns go beyond your own development to include the development of the entire planet with all of its inhabitants, because you no longer want to differentiate between people. 

You keep your faith in the future without following naive conceptions. Maybe you finally feel like you can break free of old unnecessary inhibitions and abide only by sensible rules, preferring to use unconventional methods and individuality to set reforms in motion. Pay attention to your dreams, because they could guide you to a better future."

The challenging square between the two planets, allows you to fight against new experiences or be unpleasantly surprised by them. Possibly you suffer from various forms of stress and emotional imbalance which put a strain on your friendships. A harried attempt to rid yourself of unnecessary inhibitions once and for all could make you appear stilted, or you have visions of the future which have no bearing on reality and therefore cannot be realized. By and large you have good intentions, but have difficulty putting them into practice because you lack an understanding of the way things are connected. A desire for change and an expansion of your intellectual dimensions fail to guide you in a specific direction. A general feeling of dissatisfaction could grab you making not only your life difficult but also getting on the nerves of everyone around you. What ever you manage to learn during this period will be hard earned. Try to restrict your spontaneity once in a while and concentrate more on the traffic on all sides of you.

2567;TRANSIT_0000000002114050;Transiting Neptune in Opposition with your Neptune;"Now you are about 85 years old and are encountering the last station of the Neptune cycle. The disintegrating tendencies which are ascribed to Neptune show up in the form of physical disability or the beginning of a psychological weakness.



At least this could be registered by others; your consciousness will take off in other directions which wont have a lot to do with general reality. It is the time in which worldly affairs become less important as you prepare to take leave of this world, calmly awaiting the new dimensions which death will eventually bring: the drive for control and action will slowly evaporate. Hopefully old fears will have dissolved and their place will be filled with a certain tranquillity. Probably you also have a need to withdraw and leave the spotlight for others. If your physical condition allows it, you could explain to the coming generation that material perspectives are often overrated and spiritual relationships neglected."
2568;TRANSIT_0000000002146818;Transiting Neptune in Trine with your Neptune;"Under the transit you are approximately 55 years old and are experiencing a harmonious period of the Neptune cycle. It should be clear to you now that an exaggerated ego presents an obstacle to living together with others and how everyone should try to do their part to contribute to a well functioning community where everyone can rely on each other. It would be wonderful if you would recognize that you havent completely given up on your dreams and ambitions but became more aware of reality. Its not necessary to give up your dreams, but merely adjust them to be more realistic.



Probably you have a need to do more for other people and to follow your intuition. Or else you get tired of constant competition and wish that you could approach your work calmly. New unexpected ideas will come up and guide you to a new direction. Your spiritual development will take on more meaning, so that you may either become active in your church or you will get interested in esoteric fields.



In any case you would like to use the remaining time to construct something useful, which will benefit the people around you. This also involves being aware of your own deeper emotions and being able to express them. Make the most of this period and try to test out your new insights and integrate them into your life."
2569;TRANSIT_0000000002130434;Transiting Neptune in Square with your Neptune;"You are now about 42 years old and in a somewhat critical phase of the Neptune cycle. Dissatisfaction and confusion could make your life difficult and make you think that your dreams will never be realized, which is a depressing thought. Maybe you are looking for a way to get to know yourself better, but are searching in the dark. Now is the time to look back on your life and consider whether you are satisfied with what you have achieved. Although the response is likely to be negative, what will only be made worse by the lack of realistic alternatives.



Be assured that you will be inclined to see everything worse than it really is. It would be better to avoid important decisions, because easier and more hopeful times will come. Try not to withdraw too much from the external world, but keep in touch with your friends, even if you dont feel much in the mood for light conversation."
2570;TRANSIT_0000000002163202;Transiting Neptune in Sextile with your Neptune;"In this period of Neptunes cycle you will examine whether you still have the same dreams or if your visions have changed. As you withdraw more from the outside world and look deep within you will discover yourself which will enable you to question if your goals are still a priority as well as help you find out what you need to ensure your happiness. The first successes or difficulties on the job will make you think; you will want to find out if you are on the right path, although instead of theorizing about the answer you respond from the gut. For you it is important to be in harmony with yourself and not to betray your own hopes, wishes and dreams. If you have neglected your own spiritual life and have paid attention only to external successes you will have to change your attitude. Maybe you havent taken full advantage of your freedom and want to make up for it now. The sensitivity with which you respond to others could enable you to discover many new opportunities. Your interests are directed to personal needs, although you dont place these over the well being of the community, so that this transit may provide wonderful experiences living together with others."
2571;TRANSIT_0000000002097666;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Neptune;The planet Neptune moves through the zodiac so slowly that its not possible to complete the journey in one lifetime. For this reason this transit can only come about shortly after birth, when the transiting Neptune becomes retrograde and crosses the position of Neptune in the birth chart. It is not very useful to interpret this transit.

Generally it can be said that you will be freed from enormous pressure and can work more calmly. With your attention not directed to external successes but towards spiritual peace, coercion or subconscious mechanisms dissolve into thin air and although its barely noticed, it will have a pleasurable effect. The changes in this phase of life should be mostly positive and therefore be acceptable to you. Intuitively you will sense the direction in which you have to go and are ready for experiments, whenever you have the feeling that it is time for something to happen. Just dont go so far that you risk everything on endeavors which you havent investigated thoroughly. Your inner transformation will be determined emotionally and depends on which area your imagination and inspiration take you. A lot can happen in artistic and creative areas."

2577;TRANSIT_0000000009191938;Transiting Neptune in Opposition with your Ascendant;"Under this transit human relationships will get out of focus and create confusion. Maybe you arent sure about what you actually expect from your partner, but find him or her unusually attractive. You could have difficulty judging the behavior or the motives of other people, maybe because you dont want to see anything but the positive side of someone. In the worst case youll have to recognize that you have been used, deceived or conned. You could get involved with someone who you feel sorry for, even if your sympathy is unfounded. There could be many misunderstandings if those involved have a different perception of the situation. For this reason it is important to work on improving communication.



Under this transit people who dont seem to be a part of this world will be attractive. Your life may be enriched by getting to know addicts, criminals, missionaries, healers or gurus, whose influence may not be entirely positive and who you may not be able to avoid even if you wanted to. In any case the solution will arise when the intensity of this transit lets off, because until then you will hardly be open to rational arguments."
2578;TRANSIT_0000000009224706;Transiting Neptune in Trine with your Ascendant;During this time you will hardly be concerned with your own advantage, which may earn you some sympathy. With your gentle charm you do your best to live in harmony with your environment. Inconsiderate behavior will put you off as you feel especially vulnerable to the hard competition of daily life. With your sensitivity, you will be able to look into the hearts of others and maybe even find a solution to their problems. You enjoy doing good deeds, listening to your intuition and realizing your ideals. Dreams and fantasies will play a large role during this period, and you will be more concerned with your spiritual development. That can happen inconspicuously because you have the ability to draw lessons out of every day contacts and to sift through new impressions. Also you examine your own behavior and your self image you carry with you. Because you are so honest, this could result in some significant insights which will remain meaningful long after this transit. This is also a good time to let your romantic vein see the light of day and to use it to bring happiness to someone you love.
2579;TRANSIT_0000000009208322;Transiting Neptune in Square with your Ascendant;"Usually this transit provides an unpleasant experience because of its confusing effects on peoples minds. During this period you could suffer from a weakened self-confidence or wallow in self-pity because you sense a vague frustration which may even lead to depression. Possibly you feel that people have been attacking you behind your back or you arent honest with other people and risk losing their trust. You could have the feeling that you have lost contact to yourself and cant see your own situation clearly. Everything is confused, the goals you have been following for so long dissolve into nothing as the motives of the people around you become foggy.



Others may see you as somewhat strange and distanced because you could have difficulties expressing yourself clearly and understandably. This could result in misunderstandings which will be difficult to resolve.



Maybe under this transit you will play the savior, although you have enough need of help yourself. Be careful when contacting new people, because you may experience disappointment. Also nightmares and sleep disorders could bring you to a point where you can no longer differentiate your imagination. Strong desires for new experiences make it easy to entice you with projects which can never be realized. It would be best to undertake something in order to experience this transit."
2580;TRANSIT_0000000009241090;Transiting Neptune in Sextile with your Ascendant;During this time you will hardly be concerned with your own advantage, which may earn you some sympathy. With your gentle charm you do your best to live in harmony with your environment. Inconsiderate behavior will put you off as you feel especially vulnerable to the hard competition of daily life. With your sensitivity, you will be able to look into the hearts of others and maybe even find a solution to their problems. You enjoy doing good deeds, listening to your intuition and realizing your ideals. Dreams and fantasies will play a large role during this period, and you will be more concerned with your spiritual development. That can happen inconspicuously because you have the ability to draw lessons out of every day contacts and to sift through new impressions. Also you examine your own behavior and your self image you carry with you. Because you are so honest, this could result in some significant insights which will remain meaningful long after this transit. This is also a good time to let your romantic vein see the light of day and to use it to bring happiness to someone you love.
2581;TRANSIT_0000000009175554;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your Ascendant;In a classical sense, this transit can bring about prophetic abilities. You feel as though your antennae were stretched out into the universe to receive messages. Unfortunately that could be confusing because you may not be able to adjust to your altered attitude. Maybe you will have a problem explaining yourself and making yourself understood. You appear soft but are somehow unreachable. The unusual charm about you could give your friends the urge to hold you to the ground and press your nose against inevitable reality. Now you are full of idealism and want to follow your spiritual inclination. You overlook the mistakes of other people such that there is a danger of being roped into working for someone without getting anything out of it, including the slightest token of appreciation. If you were conscious of reality and were a mature human being before this transit, you will probably desire nothing but an opportunity to live in harmony with universal principles and to perform good works.
2582;TRANSIT_0000000009437698;Transiting Neptune in Conjunction with your MC;"If you enter this transit at an age when you are choosing your professional orientation, you wont have an easy time. There is a danger that you will chase after your dreams or want to escape the reality of every day life. Maybe you cant decide which profession you want to learn or if it is worth while continuing at the university. Possibly you will doubt the significance of something which you have been completely satisfied doing for years. It will be difficult to make the right decision especially since you dont go about it consequently or with perseverance. You should listen to the whisperings of your inner voice. If you dream of influence, fame and  fortune, but arent willing to work for it, you may be wasting your time. The best thing to do would be to turn to people you think you can trust and who know you well.



If you are artistically active, this transit may be very useful to you by activating your imagination and getting started on projects which you have wanted to realize for a long time. Your sensitivity is well developed, which makes you successful at helping others."
2583;TRANSIT_0000000009503234;Transiting Neptune in Sextile with your MC;"In this phase you will invest a lot of idealism in realizing your professional goals. Even if others have little understanding for you ambitions, that wont stop you from making your dreams come true. In dealing with your colleagues you display great sensitivity and take their needs into consideration. Because your work is inspired and you have a great deal of imagination, you could be especially successful in a creative field. Still your concern is not primarily your external success, money or status; for you it is simply enough to have the opportunity to perform good deeds and otherwise be left alone.



Possibly you want to get into a social profession or demonstrate your compassion at work by always taking time to listen to other peoples problems. Certainty of your career goals may come about suddenly; when your inner voice speaks to you loud and clear. Rely on your intuition and follow your desires, because this is a harmonious transit which wont lead you astray."
2584;TRANSIT_0000000009470466;Transiting Neptune in Square with your MC;"During this time you may be prone to dream about fantasy professions. If there is something keeping you from seeing reality its probably your ambitious thinking. However it could be expressed in any number of different ways. Possibly you overestimate your abilities, dream about a career, power and wealth without wanting to work for it, and then suffer one disappointment after the other. Either that or you hide your light under a bushel and feel vulnerable, weak and insecure, which causes you to doubt your accomplishments. A loss of orientation could take over, so that you no longer know if you have set out on the right professional path or if everything up until now has been pointless and is in need of change. 



This is a difficult phase, during which you should stay as calm as possible to avoid letting disappointments throw you off track, everyone has to wake up sooner or later. If you have been placing too much emphasis on status symbols you will have a lesson to learn. It is wonderful when your value is confirmed at work. But at the core of every Neptune transit exaggerated powers of ego are dissolved. In this period you will recognize what really counts in your life and why you are loved."

2587;TRANSIT_0000000009454146;Transiting Pluto in Oposition with your MC;"This transit will get to your roots, so to speak, to your family, your background, home and surroundings. There may be dramatic developments in these areas, which can be expressed in various ways. At worst, you will be confronted with the death of someone close to you, but that may not be the case. Developments may manifest themselves in the purchase of a house, the kids may grow up and move out or Grandma may move in. It could come to painful separations which make you stop and think. The relationship to your parents will become more important, giving you the opportunity to recognize mechanisms and to free yourself from them, even if you are convinced that youve long since successfully gotten rid of the restricting mechanisms. You win and lose simultaneously, because Pluto always works both ways. Family conflicts which have been swept under the carpet, could finally be brought out into the open turning into a healing process.



If you succeed in proving your strength during this period of time, it you could benefit you a lot. If you start off with maneuvers intended to help you avoid this process, you will have to pay for it because Pluto operates under the principle of ""cause and effect""."
2588;TRANSIT_0000000000016962;Transiting Pluto in Opposition with your Sun;"This could be an eventful period of your life, in which you discover a lot about yourself. Probably you will be confronted with crises and extreme experiences which will force you to think about your behavior and maybe make some changes. If you get radical and prove yourself to be inconsiderate, convinced that it is necessary to fight for your interests, you will either be placing yourself under pressure or letting yourself be put under pressure. Power games may become commonplace, although this wont get anyone involved anywhere. Maybe you are determined to try to climb the ladder of success by any means possible, which wont make it easy for your family and friends to find the right tone of voice and if you dont watch out, you may lose the sympathy of some people.



It would do you good to calm down and relax a little; it is up to you whether these important developments will come about through pain, injury or taking frequent looks in the mirror and making compromises. In the end you will see your self and your goals more clearly. Take care of yourself during this time and pay special attention to your health, since you have an inclination to exaggerate you could drag your physical condition into your suffering."
2589;TRANSIT_0000000000049730;Transiting Pluto in Trine with your Sun;"During this period of your life you should work on your self image. Increasing self-confrontation and introspection will help you to get to know yourself better and thus be able to find out what is really important to you and to formulate your goals clearly. Additionally you have enough strength and energy to make the necessary corrections in your life and to follow the interests you have been neglecting up until now. Charm could help you to construct something significant. Independence will be extremely important to you; thus you wont let anyone tell you what to do. Still you will have to accept changes, possibly external events and crises will force you to take your life in your own hand, so that afterwards you can claim to have undertaken something for your own healing.



Under this transit you should discover your true identity and work up enough honesty to accept the less pleasant sides of your personality. This is an important time of your life and you can represent your interests without having destructive effects on others. Experience not only with power and determination but also with losses, will hopefully turn you into a more mature human being."

2592;TRANSIT_0000000000000578;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Sun;"This is an important and powerful transit which will force you to develop your personality. In an effort to discover new paths or even risking a new beginning you look behind the scenes and examine what goes on beneath the surface of human relationships. This could place you under considerable pressure or cause you to act with the intention of exercising control over your environment. Even your great potential is dependent on what forces are at work to motivate you.



Setting ambitious goals is no guarantee of success. Maybe you feel that in spite of hard work you arent accomplishing anything and are wasting your time, although you have so much energy at your disposal that you dont have to worry about running out. Reorientation is necessary, but wont be possible without losses or detours. Make things as easy on yourself as you can during this phase of life and try to stay relaxed. If subtle fears keep you from perceiving changes or make you want to force your will on other people, it wont have a positive effect."
2593;TRANSIT_0000000000328258;Transiting Pluto in Sextile with your Moon;"During this time try to intensify the contact to your inner world and avoid acting contrary to your emotions. You have the ability to bring out conflicts which have been suppressed for a long time and work through them relatively painless. Maybe a new erotic contact will help you to confront your emotions honestly and to get to know yourself better. Women will leave a lasting impression on you in this phase of life and could lead you in the right direction. Closeness should also develop in your family because you will talk openly with each other and everyone will be able to admit weaknesses. You recognize the meaning of a warm and secure home, if you havent already made such a home for yourself, you will do so now. Intuition will guide you in the right direction no matter what you do and probably you will be able to advise your friends in emotional matters.



The most positive aspect of this transit is that you will be able to conquer old fears and get your head together. It could prove to be constructive if you were to spend some time thinking about your childhood and your relationship to your mother."
2594;TRANSIT_0000000000262722;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Moon;"Under this transit there is a danger of becoming overwhelmed by your emotions and being ruled by them. You act on impulse and usually follow your intuition. This will depend on your spiritual life, making the position of the Moon in your birth chart important. In any case you will try to improve contact to your inner world and not live in opposition to your emotions. Especially new sexual experiences or a confrontation with death could be emotional enough to bring problems to light which have been hidden away in a corner since your childhood. If you are afraid of your feelings, you will suppress them until the day when you wont be able to control them any longer thus leading to an emotional outburst.



In this period of your life you may have to deal with violence or pain. Especially women have to learn to form a new attitude toward life and not to fight development, even if it is associated with suffering. The Moon stands for the femininity in everyone, where an encounter with a woman could be especially valuable, regardless of whether you are male or female. Your family will be very important to you, so take care that you dont cause any unnecessary emotional suffering to your parents, siblings or children."
2595;TRANSIT_0000000000295490;Transiting Pluto in Square with your Moon;"You should be careful not to hurt other people due to your own oversensitivity. In this phase your feelings will be very confused, so that you will be forced to deal with your inner processes, if you havent done so for a long time. Suppressed conflicts may surface and want to be solved which could overwhelm you without accepting help from others. Maybe you would like to start a therapy or seek advice from a good friend.



This transit, like all Pluto transits, concerns transformation and you are challenged to get your emotions together. Maybe at the end of this transit you will recognize that you have to distance yourself from people who you have hurt by putting them under pressure. Encounters with women could be difficult, but productive in spite of all this. Relationships may even turn out to be reproductive, a pregnancy cant be ruled out under this transit."

Maybe you overestimate the power of intellect and neglect your spiritual development, such that others accuse you of being cold and stubborn. When your mind has been stimulated it is often difficult for you to keep it under control and to filter out the realistic and constructive ideas from the mass of thoughts. Curiosity could get you into trouble when it bothers other people causing them to avoid you.



Looking behind the scenes to discover the truth and gain insights which you wont be able to work through. Maybe your thoughts will be confused such that you are no longer sure what you should believe. Or you become so attached to your way of seeing things that other arguments no longer make an impression on you.



This transit will give you an unusual power of understanding, but also has its problems. Use your knowledge cautiously and dont be satisfied with explanations which dont seem to be completely true."
2599;TRANSIT_0000000000574018;Transiting Pluto in Trine with your Mercury;"This Pluto transit will lead you to explore your environment thoroughly, showing no fear of unpleasant surprises.

It is also beneficial that you can work through your insights and incorporate them into your every day life. There is no trace of hesitation when it comes to drawing conclusions from your experiences, even when it involves great changes.



Make use of this phase to continue your education and to train your mind, otherwise you may feel like you have taken on too much and be frustrated. Look for opportunities to prove your intellect and advance professionally. To stimulate your mind all that is required is the proper nutrients. In addition you are aware that knowledge is power and are in a position to make use your understanding for the benefit of worthwhile projects.

2602;TRANSIT_0000000000524866;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Mercury;This transit will activate your intelligence but will also bring danger with it. You could get so caught up in a single idea that you are no longer open to reasonable arguments and reject every discussion about it. Maybe you will often raise your voice or feel insulted if no one wants to listen to you. Other people want to convince you to think the way they do, even though they arent always true to their own convictions, but are constantly finding new things to believe in. Make every effort to keep yourself open to other peoples arguments. If you succeed you will be capable of recognizing your mental power and of rising to every intellectual challenge. Whereas you tend to delve deeper, not being satisfied with superficial explanations. Especially research and detective work could be accomplished effectively. Possibly a need to write a book or engage in some other literary activity will arise. If you go about doing things too strictly and continue to show respect for the intellectual accomplishments of other people, this transit will bring you many important insights.

Ties to other people will be intensified and you wont take anything that happens in this respect lightly. Your love life could take control of you, such that you wont hesitate to continue a relationship which brings you more pain than joy. There is a danger that you will manipulate others or that others will gain control over you. Power struggles may become commonplace and maybe you will look for a new partner who makes you feel superior and who lets you tell him what to do. Act cautiously under this transit, because you could risk losing the sympathy of others. Appearing strong and determined, you may feel insecure when meeting new people.



In any case you could learn a lot about living with other people and you should always try to give in at the right moment. Be careful that you dont accidentally hurt the people who are important to you, not being immune to excesses of any kind."

Certainly you dont go around looking for a fight, but also arent inclined to run away from a necessary conflict. Possibly it could come to a separation which should have positive consequences for you. Generally this transit will be a test to human bonding, thereby determining which relationships have a potential for surviving over a longer period of time.



Probably you can get more enjoyment out of sensuality and give it a higher priority. If you should fall in love during this period, your feelings will be unusually strong and make you believe that your life will never be the same again. Maybe this is also the truth, because relationships stand a good chance of surviving once they have been initiated.

It wont be necessary to force yourself to hold back, but should live out every whim, because this is a harmonious aspect, which will do you no harm. Enjoy the energy which will be given to you and try to make the best use of it as possible. You will have enough time and energy to build a foundation to last, and maybe even serve as an example to others, because you radiate optimism and are good at motivating groups.



Things arent going as they should if you dont manage to accomplish much during this phase of life."
2612;TRANSIT_0000000001049154;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Mars;At the moment you feel invincible and have powers at your disposal and strength like never before. The ability to work tirelessly may allow you to accomplish something extraordinary. If you are dissatisfied, and feel like you are about to explode, you should definitely look for a way to vent your energy. Physical labor or weightlifting wouldnt be inappropriate. It is important to receive encouragement during this period and to aim for the right goal. You could be inclined to overestimate your own interests, take off on an ego trip and act recklessly. With as much strength as you have, you would be capable of suppressing others for a while and get along without support, but such behavior will take its toll eventually. In the worst case, violent attacks or accidents could forcibly remind you to think about others. You want to use your energy now to protect yourself from being manipulated or investigated, which is basically alright, but dont do anything you arent sure is the right thing to do. There will be some changes in your sex life, because your sexual desires are unusual. Dont neglect tenderness because there is a danger that conflicts with your partner will be carried over into your bed. Avoid entering any unnecessary risks at this time, such as participating in dangerous sports, driving too fast or placing your complete trust in strangers.
2613;TRANSIT_0000000001311298;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Jupiter;"During this transit you will do best when you include others in your planning and share your resources. Both Jupiter and also Pluto are associated with sharing and with community, so that selfish thinking wont get you anywhere. Dont expect gratitude in exchange for your generosity, but dont let yourself be used.



Optimism and strength will combine during this phase to produce a mixture which promises to be successful. Great challenges dont scare you off because you try to integrate your experiences adequately into your view of the world. Your ideals are probably so high that you can hardly realize them. Avoid getting frustrated and trying to force your morals on the rest of the world. It is important to remember the value of respect and tolerance, or your moral arrogance will cause you to be avoided. The ability to present your attitudes toward life in an understandable manner to the people nearest to you, may create enough influence to reinforce your claim on leadership."
2614;TRANSIT_0000000001376834;Transiting Pluto in Sextile with your Jupiter;"During this time you are very cooperative and helpful and therefore are especially open for group projects. You have a positive effect on people and work convincingly toward your ideals without neglecting your own needs or making yourself a servant to someone else. A certain strength has been given to you, with whose help you can work constructively and maybe even climb up the corporate ladder.



Also the search for Truth and modern social forms has become an important pastime for you during this phase. Also you spend your time thinking about living with others peacefully and how existing resources can be used sensibly without recklessly exploiting our Mother Earth. 



If you are confronted with legal battles or have to deal with government officials, make an effort to prepare yourself well; you could be successful. There should also be no problems with your boss or other authorities because you are respected and people trust you. Probably you will get rid of your previous attitudes and convictions by the end of this transit. Still you will certainly not live without a goal or orientation, but take on challenges with a complex outlook."
2615;TRANSIT_0000000001344066;Transiting Pluto in Square with your Jupiter;"This is a period of great changes, because your outlook on life will be up against hard tests. Possibly you feel a loss of orientation and doubt the sense in everything that you have done up until now. Great disappointments could arise and make you feel like the ground is being pulled out from under your feet. Still that should make you aware that everything you experience only serves to convince you that your existence is merely a part of a great cosmic game whose rules are revealed when life is not always happy and satisfying.



Maybe you will compensate for the frustration you are feeling now by overloading yourself with work and striving for achievement by any means possible. Or you try to hide your insecurity behind an inappropriate arrogance. There is a danger of trying to ram your head through walls and forgetting that you are a social being. Why not placing your abilities at the service of your community. As you try to be as cooperative as possible and avoid larger conflicts; you could speak in a tone of voice that others find insulting. Before you let yourself be convinced of obscure thoughts or join any extreme belief systems, learn to trust your friends. Make it clear that you are in search of Truth and this path has to be walked in spite of its hurdles."

2618;TRANSIT_0000000001589826;Transiting Pluto in Opposition with your Saturn;"During this phase of your life you will encounter the weaknesses of your personality more often. This transit is designed to further introspection, which can best be achieved by feelings like hate, envy, jealousy or anger. Avoid strategies, games of hide and seek or defense mechanisms wont do you any good at this time. The more you fight against accepting your weaknesses, the more painful the process will be. Inferiority complexes, fears of loss or failure will be mercilessly exposed, but can be overcome if you are honest with yourself and dont object to accepting help from others.



If you should feverishly cling to status symbols or professional positions to mask your uncertainty, you will have to learn to let go, if necessary by force. Structures can break down undermining the security which may not have even been good for you, but made life more pleasant. Financial losses are also possible such that you may have to restrict yourself and thereby learning to recognize what it is that you really need in order to live.



This transit offers valuable opportunities, also if they arent recognized right away and you would have rather done without certain experiences."
2619;TRANSIT_0000000001622594;Transiting Pluto in Trine with your Saturn;"During this period you will be capable of doing something constructive, without expecting to see results immediately. With your hard work and stamina you could impress your boss or do well in your own business because you have an eye for detail and your work is thorough. You are very realistic and get along with very few luxury articles; amusing yourself isnt as important to you as self discipline. Maybe you arent entertainment personified, but you take your responsibility seriously and do your best to help those in need.



Under this transit you will create structures which are well thought out and highly valued. Still, a transformation will take place within your being, because you work through your experiences adequately and your personality is becoming more solid. You find the courage to confront your weaknesses and overcome them, even if it is a difficult process. At the end of the development a consciousness should have evolved which can best be described with the word integrity. Everything you have achieved was well earned, because nothing is free."

2622;TRANSIT_0000000001573442;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Saturn;"This transit will provide you with the opportunity to free yourself of social obligations and discover the values which matter to you individually. Maybe this path will lead to the loss of recognized status symbols; it may be possible that you will have to give up your job or some of your possessions. Even if it hurts at first, it holds opportunity for you. You will test the limits of your stamina and develop something like humility. You could become aware how little a person actually needs, if he isnt subject to the constant seductions of advertising; consuming or exercising influence on the society doesnt necessarily make anyone happy. Old inhibitions or fears could be overpowered during this phase of life. Possibly there is a conflict which will lead to the break down of structures, because Plutos energy unloads itself suddenly or even violently. There could especially be conflicts with your father, if you refuse to submit as is expected of you. The result of your development in this period will be more freedom of movement; you have a gone through a change of consciousness, which has relieved you of superficial burdens. In spite of all of this you will have no trouble working disciplined, because you have clear ambitions."
2623;TRANSIT_0000000001835586;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Uranus;During this transit you would like to free yourself from all restrictions and do everything to form your own individuality. You could approach things with more intensity and should be prepared to deal with a lack of understanding. Possibly you are known as an eccentric. Provocation or blind activism wont get you very far, but you will recognize this soon enough. Plutos energies unload themselves suddenly and powerful, which is why conflicts with authorities can develop. However, you wont be able to keep that up for the entire duration of this transit because it will last several years. The goal is to recognize your desires and not isolate yourself from society, because man is a gregarious animal, who tends to follow the herd.
2624;TRANSIT_0000000001901122;Transiting Pluto in Sextile with your Uranus;"This should be a very creative phase of life, because you are in the right frame of mind to test everything out. The more unusual the experiment is the more it interests you. These experiences will leave traces behind which will change your personality. New unexplored facets will come to the surface. Probably it will quickly come to a dramatic development because such energetic transits tend to bring unexpected events. While living out your spontaneity and tired conventions you dont put everything at risk. With a capacity for learning which is almost limitless, your mind is alert and eager to investigate interesting fields, which certainly includes Astrology.



Under this transit you should have a satisfying social life and be able to meet people and expand your circle of friends. If some people have put you under pressure or have tried to restrict you in the past, you will get up the nerve to take leave of them, because it will be increasingly important to you to have as much freedom as possible. Generally there should be a lot of movement in your life, which will prove itself to have positive effects."
2625;TRANSIT_0000000001868354;Transiting Pluto in Square with your Uranus;"During this time you will have to prove your flexibility, because your life will be marked by tremendous changes. If you refuse to conform to the changing circumstances while clinging to out-dated values, you will make things more difficult for yourself. External events may overwhelm you and place everything which you have built in question.



This transit may manifest itself in such a way that you beat your head against a wall and search for change at any price, whereas structures which are worthwhile retaining are also destroyed. You shouldnt wonder if you lose your orientation and become insecure. Dont rebel against all types of institutions and authorities without a clear purpose, otherwise people wont take you seriously.



Seen positively you have the chance to rid yourself of concepts which have lost their validity. This will be a large step toward the further development of your personality. To avoid trouble, act as cautiously as possible."

2628;TRANSIT_0000000002130498;Transiting Pluto in Square with your Neptune;"Having reached a mature age, this transit could leave you feeling insecure, because it causes confusion in your spiritual life. Maybe you feel like you have lost contact to your inner self and sense longing which you thought you had overcome. Your active imagination wont help you, but will only cause confusion. Structures which you have become attached to will disappear leaving a void. Possibly you dont understand what is actually happening and wont see clearly until the transit has passed. Just dont let yourself be drawn to extreme views or exotic belief systems, even if you feel a need to change your life and are trying to find peace within a larger community.



Now the challenge is to look within yourself and explore all the facets of your personality. If you have been able to see through deceptions or like to escape into certain fantasies, at the end of this transit you will be forced to accept the truth."
2629;TRANSIT_0000000002163266;Transiting Pluto in Sextile with your Neptune;"If you are effected by this transit, you are probably between 50 and 55 years old and in the process of delving deep into your psyche to explore the last remaining secrets. You would like to spur on your development and ban all illusion from your life. Maybe you feel that you can suddenly see more clearly and wont be deceived so easily. If you have found a faith or have become active in a religious group, this decision will be well thought out, not an act of blind fanaticism.



You will have the opportunity to become aware of subconscious patterns of behavior in the area of life represented by the house position of Neptune in your birth chart. Possibly you will fulfill long sought after dreams, whereas other peoples reaction wont make any difference to you, although it will be difficult to let go of desires which cant be fulfilled. Enjoy this period, because your emotional state will be stimulated and you wont have any difficulty showing your emotions."
2630;TRANSIT_0000000002097730;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Neptune;This transit requires self-recognition in the areas which Neptune is most likely to cloud up. This period of life will give the chance to see through self-deception, fraud and illusion. Subconscious patterns of behavior in the area of life represented by the house position of Neptune in your birth chart will be uncovered and either altered or consciously put to use. Maybe you feel like you can suddenly see more clearly and wont be deceived so easily. This transit will not only effect whats going on inside you but also external events. Still you can steer your energy into certain projects, which you have been planning for a long time, but havent had the confidence to try to realize them. You can assume that you see possibilities realistic and arent deceiving yourself. Since everyone in your age group is effected by this transit to the same extent, you arent living through it alone. It will be possible to get together with others who are feeling the same way. The individual effects are the result of Neptunes house position and its aspects to the other planets.
2631;TRANSIT_0000000002359874;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your Pluto;This transit can only occur shortly after birth when Pluto is retrograde. An interpretation doesnt seem to make a lot of sense.
2632;TRANSIT_0000000002425410;Transiting Pluto in Sextile with your Pluto;"Although you are now experiencing a time of change, it wont throw you off. Having learned to accept the fact that no one can hold onto people or situations, you are willing to let go. Increasing your awareness and putting new insights into practice presents no problem for you. An awareness of your weaknesses and the less attractive sides of your personality allows you to accept yourself as you are. Instead of wasting energy trying to paint things in rosy colors, you search for the truth, even if it is unpleasant. You could serve as an example for others. Probably you will be often asked for advice, because you are at peace with yourself, which is the result of introspection. You may influence your environment, but will hardly use these abilities for your own benefit. The wonderful thing about this transit is that you are open for new experiences and dont let yourself become uncertain.



If you are looking for a more individual interpretation, look at Plutos house position in your birth chart and its aspects to other planets."
2633;TRANSIT_0000000002392642;Transiting Pluto in Square with your Pluto;This transit presents a great challenge. Possibly you will be in the midst of a mid-life crisis and will have to take note of changes which are disturbing. You tend to get worked up about something that can burst like a bubble becoming nothing. You can overestimate your strength and get started on things which are too big for you to handle. So be careful and dont disregard the advice of friends, even if it is difficult for you to listen. The lesson of this transit is that no one can hold onto the past, but must give in to the changing tides. If you start acting stubborn and inflexible, more intensive events will force you to discover your flexibility. Dont ignore your weaknesses but work on them and integrate them into every day life. Contact to others could be made difficult by your tendency to want to have your way and take on a position of leadership. You will notice that you change your behavior and have to show respect for others peoples decisions. The only comfort for you in this phase is that you are in a position to learn a lot, especially about yourself.
2634;TRANSIT_0000000002409026;Transiting Pluto in Trine with your Pluto;"Although you are now experiencing a time of change, that wont throw you off.

2635;TRANSIT_0000000009192002;Transiting Pluto in Opposition with your Ascendant;"During this period, people will enter your life who have a special meaning for you. Unfortunately, these contacts wont necessarily always be pleasant or harmonious. There is more of a danger that you will be watched, put under pressure, become dependent or be tossed around at the whim of dubious characters. This could lead to a conflict which will enable you to be freed from the clutches of these people and live independently again. You should watch out that you dont use unfair methods, even if your opponent is strong and relentless.



This confrontation will bring you the opportunity to discover your own strengths and to learn to deal with extreme behavior. You will recognize what independence means to you. The path may not be as dramatic as all this, but may lead to a union with someone who represents a mature personality to you. Even in this case you shouldnt give up your individuality in order to chase after someone you admire; be assured that everyone has to find a personal specific solution."
2636;TRANSIT_0000000009224770;Transiting Pluto in Trine with your Ascendant;"This transit will offer you many opportunities to make positive changes deep within you. Will power, energy and self-confidence give you the potential to make an unusually intense impression on people. Because this is a harmonious transit, you will have a lot of influence on people you are close to, and friendships will bring more mutual satisfaction. A great responsibility weighs upon you, but you are now aware of it and are ready to act accordingly. Maybe you will be placed in a ""power position"" for the duration of this transit, which will require you to act in the interests of many people. Go for it, because you should know that acting out of pure egotism wont get you anywhere and should therefore be in a position to make decisions for the benefit of a lot of people. Thereby you shouldnt hesitate to get away from people or circumstances which arent good for you. This will lead to deeper more meaningful friendships than you ever believed to be possible. This kind of enrichment to your life will encourage you to go off in directions which you havent been aware of up until now."
2637;TRANSIT_0000000009208386;Transiting Pluto in Square with your Ascendant;This is a challenging transit, which wont pass unnoticed. There may be a lot of excitement especially in your personal relationships. If these leave you feeling dissatisfied, that will probably be noticeable during the course of this transit. Maybe you will be forced to end some relationships. The more you struggle against it, the more painful it will be. That's the way Pluto works! Painful experiences like these make room for new sensations, even if at first there seems to be no indication that the pain will ever end. Now your challenge is to make changes in your life, because this transit represents a new beginning. Old baggage can be thrown overboard quickly, which is why you wont hesitate to get away from people or circumstances which arent good for you. Unfortunately there is a danger that you wont be able to deal with failures and then act impulsively out of frustration which could cause accidents or end in violent outbreaks. Character traits which you have ignored up until now will be expressed so clearly that you will be forced to deal with them. Maybe you will put yourself under pressure and not be able to relax. If this is the case, traveling or meditating would do you good. This period of time may be an easy one for you, but you also have the strength to master every crisis and to profit from each one in the end.

2640;TRANSIT_0000000009437762;Transiting Pluto in Conjunction with your MC;This time is suitable for working on professional plans, earning public recognition and contemplating the meaning of what you are doing. If you dont try to make the necessary changes now, you will have them forced on you, either by losing your job or through a loss of status. You will get the bill for your past actions and if you cheated, manipulated or took part in games of power, that will be avenged. You ask yourself what it is that you expect to get out of life and wont let yourself be distracted from achieving what you set out to do. If you have found a fulfilling activity, you could work hard and become embittered, but dont put yourself under pressure. If you are dissatisfied with what you have achieved up until now, you could change your profession overnight or discover a new passion. Possibly you will be promoted and will receive power, but you don't know yet how to deal with it. Anyway self-doubt and changes in your effectiveness in public will lead to new directions in your professional and social life.
2641;TRANSIT_0000000009503298;Transiting Pluto in Sextile with your MC;"This is an appropriate time for realizing your professional plans, such that you can draw more satisfaction out of your daily efforts. During the long course of this period you may see a promotion or even a change in employment. Because this is a harmonious transit, you will enthusiastically delve into new activities and also be prepared to carry more responsibility. You ask yourself what you really want to achieve in life and which position you want to attain. Because you arent prone to delusions of grandeur at the moment, you make changes that are sure to be profitable. With your determination you know all too well that elbowing your way forward wont get you anywhere, but balancing the interests of everyone involved will. Once you have found a fulfilling activity, you will use all your strength to work for it.



Maybe you will be invested with power, which you will have to learn to wield, although that shouldnt be difficult. In any case, changes to your effectiveness in public will lead you in new directions."
2642;TRANSIT_0000000009470530;Transiting Pluto in Square with your MC;"During this time you wont be able to avoid questioning your professional plans as well as your attempts to earn public recognition. Furthermore you seem to be questioning everything that you have been doing. Maybe during the course of this period you will become so embittered that you will call others to stand up and rebel against you. If you dont make the necessary changes in your own ways now, you will have changes forced on you, either by losing your job or through a loss of status. You will get the bill for your past actions and if you are cheated, manipulated or got involved in games of power, they will be avenged. You ask yourself what it is that you expect to get out of life and dont let yourself be distracted from achieving what you set out to do. 



The consequences of this transit dont necessarily have to be negative; one thing is clear: there are some changes that are necessary, it only depends on how you deal with these. If you dont resist them, they will bear fruit which could take your professional life in a new direction and influence your reputation."

Maybe you will be invested with power, which you will have to learn to wield, although that shouldnt be difficult. In any case, changes to your effectiveness in public will lead you in new directions."
2644;ASTROMAP_0000000000003268;AstroWorld Cartography;"Already in ancient times astrologers were aware of the relation between the signs of the zodiac and the countries of this planet. The discovery of planets and continents, the forming of new states and various societal changes, were responsible for constantly adapting the existing astrological theories to the prevailing consciousness of the times. Therefore it is certainly no coincidence in this present time of growing ""Globalisation"", including worldwide communication and mobility, that Astro-Cartography gets more meaningful. Basically the world has become a smaller place. Therefore it is so easy these days to establish relations with foreign people in their respective countries.



The modern adaptation of Astro-Cartography has definitely to be credited to Jim Lewis who developed this modern form of Astro-Cartography in the seventies. It was only after examining the qualities of various places on this planet that gave a new meaning to our existence. That ability to change one's life by changing one's location is the unique gift of Jim Lewis's Astro-Cartography.



As long ago as the middle ages, astrologers calculated so called Relocation-Charts, using a different place of birth for the calculation of the chart in order to interpret one's abilities and downfalls while being at this place. Since the same birth time is applied, the planetary positions within the Zodiac remain unchanged.  Only the AC-DC and the MC-IC axis, as well as the houses, will change their positions. Of course you may create as many relocated charts as you wish.



But it goes further, since an important factor when creating an Astro-Map is the calculation and display of all the positions on the surface of the Earth where one or more of your natal planets touch a Horoscope-Axis. (The AC-DC axis appears in form of a curve, while the MC is shown as a straight line and the IC as an interrupted line). The underlying thought behind these constellations is that they are places of potential personal power where the planetary energies are more strongly expressed. Besides the axis positions of the planets, the so called Parans, the points where planets intersect the formerly described lines, become important when interpreting this kind of chart. Their influence can be felt within a radius of roughly 200 miles, although the energy of the Paran also applies to the entire range of the degree of latitude. By choosing places that are important to you, you can create relocation charts that can be subjected to detailed analysis. 



For example, should you move to another city or country, you can examine whether one of your natal planets is intersecting or aspecting one of these lines. Whether these energies manifest as rather problematic or as supportive, depends on the planets involved.

Apart from using Astro-Cartography in personal Astrology it is also applicable in mundane Astrology."
2645;PERSONAR_0000000000003268;The Personar;"This astrological technique was developed by Peter Orban and Ingrid Zinnel and serves as a tool to study a natal chart in greater depth. The basic underlying principle is the theory that human beings having multiple personalities at their disposal, even if we are only partly aware of it. Therefore the natal chart can be understood as a stage where the planets adopt the role of archetypal (inner) persons. Of these, we may be aware or not. They may even represent our Ego-ideal or, on the contrary, their existence may be denied. The twelve archetypes are: the warrior, the beauty, the intellectual, the mother (the small child), the hero (the father), reason, the others, the fanatic, the philosopher, the old one (representing the law) and the master.



Each Personar-Chart serves the purpose of further interpreting one of these inner persons. While the natal chart combines them, they are isolated in the Personar, in order to examine a certain inner person. This will be done by creating a horoscope of the particular moment when the natal sun arrives for the first time at the position being occupied by the  planet (person) concerned, the natal chart being the Sun-Personar. Thus we arrive at the birth chart of this inner person associated with the sun. The interpretation of this archetype allows us to learn more about our hidden character traits, hopefully leading to the acceptance of even the bad ones. Including the natal chart, which is the Sun-Personar, there are 10 Personars, which provide a detailed description of the 12 archetypal persons (Venus and Mercury represent both two of these persons).
